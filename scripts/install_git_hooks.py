"""Install the QSD pre-commit hook into .git/hooks/.

This is the BARE-GIT install path. If you already use the
`pre-commit` framework (https://pre-commit.com/), prefer:
    pre-commit install
which reads .pre-commit-config.yaml at the repo root.

This script writes a tiny POSIX-shell shim to .git/hooks/pre-commit
that invokes scripts/git_hook_pre_commit.py via Python. The shim
is shell-based (not Python) because git's hook protocol expects an
executable file with the exact name `pre-commit` (no extension);
on Windows-with-Git-Bash the shell shim runs under MSYS bash, on
Linux/macOS under /bin/sh — both with `python` resolved through
PATH.

The shim is small and self-contained so the hook keeps working
even if scripts/git_hook_pre_commit.py is mid-refactor in a
working-tree branch. The shim itself never changes; only the
target script does.

Run:
    python scripts/install_git_hooks.py

Re-run the same command to refresh the shim (idempotent).

Uninstall:
    rm .git/hooks/pre-commit       # POSIX
    del .git\\hooks\\pre-commit    # Windows cmd
