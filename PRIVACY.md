# QSD Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 12, 2026

This policy describes data handling by the open-source QSD Hive desktop
application and the reference services operated at `QSD.tech`. A separately
operated validator, task provider, Relay, or integration may have its own
policy.

## Data kept on the computer

Hive stores account profiles, encrypted QSD keystore files, settings, task
state, logs, miner enrollment state, and optional Relay credentials in the
operating system's application-data directories. Wallet passphrases and private
keys are intended to remain on the user's computer and are not account-recovery
data held by QSD. Losing the keystore JSON and passphrase can permanently lose
access to the wallet.

Hive's analytics functions are disabled and do not transmit product-usage
events. Hive contains no advertising tracker.

## Data sent when network features are used

Hive sends only the information needed for a feature the user starts or
configures. Depending on that feature, this can include:

- public wallet addresses and public keys;
- signed transactions, task actions, proofs, and anti-replay values;
- chain, balance, task, reward, and update requests;
- miner enrollment identifiers, hardware capability information, and mining
  proofs when the user enables mining;
- bounded resource descriptions and signed workload receipts when the user
  enables Edge Agent, Relay, or Mother Hive participation; and
- a public key, signature, and short-lived link code when the user explicitly
  links a supported integration such as Sky Fang.

Private wallet keys and wallet passphrases must not be included in those
requests. Reference web and API infrastructure may retain ordinary security
and operational logs such as source IP address, request time, endpoint, status,
and rate-limit events. These logs are used to operate, secure, and diagnose the
service and are not sold for advertising.

Optional external notification storage is contacted only when an operator
configures the required credentials. A custom Core, gateway, task provider,
Relay, or integration receives the requests directed to it and is controlled
by its operator rather than by this repository.

## User controls

Mining, task execution, and resource sharing are opt-in controls in Hive. Users
can stop tasks, disconnect a Relay, close their account session, or uninstall
Hive. Uninstalling does not automatically destroy wallet backups or every local
application-data file, because doing so could destroy funds. Users should back
up the keystore first and then remove remaining application data manually when
they intentionally want it erased.

Public ledger transactions and accepted proofs are replicated records. They
cannot generally be deleted without invalidating the ledger.

## Security and contact

Do not send wallet private keys, keystore files, passphrases, API tokens, or
other secrets in a bug report. Report security issues through the private
process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). General project contact and current
documentation are available at <https://QSD.tech>.
