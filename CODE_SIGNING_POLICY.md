# QSD Code Signing Policy

This policy covers public QSD Hive releases for Windows. It complements the
[build and release guidelines](QSD/docs/docs/BUILD_AND_RELEASE_GUIDELINES.md)
and the [security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Signing status

QSD applied for the SignPath Foundation open-source code signing program, but
the application was declined for now because the project does not yet have
enough external public trust signals for Foundation sponsorship. No QSD
artifact may be described as SignPath-signed unless a future paid or Foundation
subscription signs that exact artifact and the final verification gates pass.

Current public Windows Hive releases are unsigned by Microsoft Authenticode.
They may be published through the stable QSD channel only when the release
owner explicitly approves the unsigned posture, all release gates pass, and
SHA-256 checksums are published at immutable URLs. Windows SmartScreen may warn
because unsigned installers have no Microsoft publisher reputation.

QSD Hive 1.3.96 adds a project-native ML-DSA-87 signature over its release
manifest and verifies installer hashes before installation. That proves
continuity with a QSD-controlled release key, but it
does not make Windows show a verified publisher and does not replace
Authenticode, timestamping, or SmartScreen reputation.

QSD will not substitute a self-signed certificate or install a private root
certificate on consumer computers to imitate public Windows trust.

## Project and roles

- Repository: <https://github.com/quantum-ledger/QSD>
- License: [MIT](LICENSE)
- Committer and reviewer: [@quantum-ledger](https://github.com/quantum-ledger)
- Release approver: [@quantum-ledger](https://github.com/quantum-ledger)

QSD currently has one repository custodian. Automated build credentials may
submit a signing request, but they cannot approve it. The release approver must
review the source revision, CI evidence, artifact manifest, and security gates
before manually approving a production signing request. GitHub and signing
accounts used for these roles must have multi-factor authentication enabled.

## What is signed

The QSD Hive Windows signing scope is limited to artifacts built from this
repository:

- the QSD Hive desktop executable;
- QSD CLI, miner, CUDA solver, Edge Agent, Edge Control, and GPU helper
  executables bundled with Hive; and
- the final QSD Hive installer.

Third-party executables and libraries are not re-signed as QSD software. Their
upstream signatures are preserved and verified where the package format and
tooling support that check.

## Trusted build and approval flow

1. A release starts from an immutable Git tag that points to a reviewed commit
   on the protected default branch.
2. GitHub-hosted runners build the unsigned Windows payload from that exact
   commit and dependency lock state. Self-hosted runner output is not eligible
   for SignPath Foundation production signing.
3. The unsigned payload is uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact before the
   SignPath connector receives the request. Local workstation uploads are for
   diagnosis only and are not production release inputs.
4. When Authenticode signing is available, SignPath or the paid signing provider
   verifies build origin and signs only paths permitted by the QSD artifact
   configuration. Each production request requires manual approval.
5. The signed payload is packaged into the installer, and the installer is
   submitted as a separate signing request from the same workflow and commit.
6. `QSD/deploy/scripts/verify_hive_nsis_payload.ps1` requires every embedded
   QSD executable to match the signed source payload byte-for-byte, and
   `verify_hive_windows_signature.ps1` rejects the release unless every
   required executable and the installer has a valid, timestamped
   Authenticode signature from the configured publisher when Authenticode
   signing is part of that release.
7. Checksums, signature evidence, source revision, release notes, and rollback
   instructions are retained with the immutable release.

Unsigned artifacts are acceptable only while QSD is in the indie/no-certificate
release posture and only with explicit disclosure on the download page. They
must never be described as Authenticode-signed, SignPath-signed, or Windows
verified-publisher releases. They must never replace bytes at an existing
immutable URL. The stable updater may point at an unsigned release only after
the owner approves the release notes, checksum evidence, smoke-test results,
and SmartScreen disclosure.

The first Authenticode-signed release is a publisher transition from existing
unsigned or locally identified builds. It requires a manual installer upgrade
after signature and checksum verification. Automatic updates resume only
between releases signed by the same trusted publisher identity.

## Release requirements

A signing request is denied when any of these conditions is true:

- the source revision is not reviewed, tagged, or clean;
- a required CI, test, secret scan, security scan, or release-evidence gate
  failed or did not run;
- the package contains an unexpected executable or an unreviewed binary;
- bundled QSD component versions do not match the Hive release;
- a wallet, passphrase, token, deployment credential, local database, or other
  private runtime state is present in the artifact;
- required Windows metadata is missing; Authenticode verification is missing
  for a release that claims Authenticode signing; or
- the release owner has not explicitly approved promotion.

Mining remains opt-in and visible to the user. The signed application must
retain clean stop and uninstall controls and must not silently enable mining or
resource sharing.

## Verification

Users can inspect a downloaded installer with Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\QSD-hive-<version>-win-x64.exe |
  Format-List Status,StatusMessage,SignerCertificate,TimeStamperCertificate
Get-FileHash .\QSD-hive-<version>-win-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

For Authenticode-signed releases, the signature status must be `Valid`, the
publisher must match the publisher declared for that release, and the SHA-256
value must match QSD's immutable release manifest. For current unsigned indie
releases, `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` is expected to report `NotSigned`; users
must verify SHA-256 and understand that a checksum detects changed bytes but
does not establish Microsoft-recognized publisher identity.

## Privacy and incident response

QSD Hive's data-handling boundaries are documented in the
[privacy policy](PRIVACY.md). Vulnerabilities or suspected signing-key misuse
must be reported through the private process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
Signing is suspended during an unresolved supply-chain incident. A compromised
credential or certificate is revoked before another release is approved.
