# publish_release.ps1 — upload a release directory to the
# QSD.tech static webroot via scp.
#
# What this script does (and just as importantly, doesn't):
#
#   It uploads the public-facing release artifacts that
#   `release/<tag>/` already contains in their finished form,
#   plus the publish-side overrides for MANIFEST.json and
#   SHA256SUMS.txt (which are scrubbed copies that strip any
#   private components from the local manifest before it
#   reaches the public web root). It does NOT build, sign,
#   tag, or change /releases/latest.txt unless you pass
#   -BumpLatest, and it does NOT touch the systemd / Caddy /
#   validator services on the VPS.
#
#   Conservative on purpose: a publish script that surprises
#   you by editing latest.txt or restarting Caddy is not the
#   kind of script you want pre-commit on Sunday morning.
#
# Inputs:
#
#   -Tag         the release tag, e.g. "v0.0.0+689fbf7". If
#                empty (default), reads the most recent
#                MANIFEST.json from release/v*/ on disk.
#   -SshTarget   ssh destination, default root@node.QSD.tech.
#                node.QSD.tech is the documented DNS for the
#                BLR1 host (vps.txt §1).
#   -Webroot     server-side root, default /var/www/QSD
#                (matches QSD/deploy/Caddyfile's `root *`).
#   -DryRun      print every scp/ssh invocation but execute
#                none of them. Use this on the first run.
#   -BumpLatest  also write `<tag>\n` to /releases/latest.txt.
#                Off by default because pinning latest is the
#                step where a botched upload becomes
#                user-visible.
#   -SkipScrubCheck
#                bypass the safety check that forbids
#                uploading a MANIFEST.json containing private
#                components (QSD-detect at the moment). Only
#                use if you've consciously decided to publish
#                a previously-private component.
#
# Typical operator flow:
#
#   # Build:
#   .\QSD\scripts\build_release.ps1
#   .\QSD\scripts\windows-installer\build_installer.ps1
#   .\QSD\deploy\scripts\publish_release.ps1 -DryRun
#   # Review the printed commands, then drop -DryRun:
#   .\QSD\deploy\scripts\publish_release.ps1
#   # Verify by curl, then promote:
#   .\QSD\deploy\scripts\publish_release.ps1 -BumpLatest
