# QSD-sdk (JavaScript SDK) — Changelog

All notable changes to the published `QSD-sdk` npm package are recorded here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-18

### Typings

- **`@deprecated` JSDoc tags added to `QSD.d.ts` for the four
  removed-in-0.4.0 methods** (`getRecentTransactions`, `getPeers`,
  `getMetricsJSON`, `getMetricsPrometheus`). TypeScript compilers
  and IDEs that honor JSDoc deprecation tags (VS Code, Cursor,
  WebStorm, etc.) will now show strikethrough on usages plus the
  migration path inline. Without this, runtime callers reading
  the JS file see the deprecation banners but TypeScript users
  importing only the type surface would not. `getTransaction` also
  carries a JSDoc note about the 0.3.1 plural-path fix so a future
  reader can correlate the spec, the runtime SDK, and the typings
  without three-file triangulation. No declared interface or class
  signature changed; this is type-system metadata only.

### Fixed

- **`getTransaction(txID)` now hits the correct path.** Earlier
  builds (≤0.3.0) called `GET /api/v1/transaction/{id}` (singular),
  which returns 404 in production — the typo dated back to the
  pre-rebrand scaffolding window. The actual handler is registered
  at `GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}` (plural) per
  `pkg/api/handlers.go:269-270` and the `openapi.yaml` spec entry
  for `/transactions/{txId}`. The bug was not caught earlier
  because `QSD.test.js` starts a fake `httptest`-style server that
  accepts any URL and asserts only on query parameters; the test
  is now path-pinned (`assert.equal(req.url, '/api/v1/transactions/tx-7')`)
  so a future regression of this kind fails CI.

### Deprecated

Four methods continue to call endpoints that are not registered on
the public `pkg/api` server. They have always returned `ApiError`
with `status: 404` against any production node; the JSDoc on each
now states this explicitly and gives the migration path. Pending
removal in **0.4.0**:

- `getRecentTransactions(address, limit)` — calls
  `/api/v1/wallet/transactions`, which has no handler. The public
  surface has no per-address recent-tx endpoint today; callers
  wanting a recent-tx feed should use
  `GET /api/v1/receipts` (paginated chain transparency feed) and
  filter client-side, or maintain their own off-chain index.
- `getPeers()` — calls `/api/v1/network/peers`. Closest analogues
  are `/api/admin/peers` (admin-only, mTLS-required;
  `pkg/api/handlers_admin.go:54`) and the dashboard's
  `/api/topology` (`internal/dashboard/dashboard.go:261`); neither
  is reachable from a JWT-bearer SDK client. Use
  `getNetworkTopology()` for the same data instead.
- `getMetricsJSON()` — calls `/api/metrics`, which is registered
  only on the operator dashboard server
  (`internal/dashboard/dashboard.go:258`, `requireAuth`-gated),
  not on the public API.
- `getMetricsPrometheus()` — same dashboard-only mismatch; calls
  `/api/metrics/prometheus`.

No public method or constructor signature changes; this is a
patch-level release. All 17 existing tests still pass; the
`getTransaction` test is the only one whose assertions were
strengthened.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-11

### Changed (publish-time rename)

- npm package id renamed from `QSD` → `QSD-sdk`. The original bare name was
  rejected by the registry's typo-squatting heuristic (similarity to `qs`,
  `esm`, `tsdx`, etc.) on first-publish, so the package was rebranded under
  the conventional `<project>-sdk` suffix. No other identifiers change: the
  on-chain brand is still QSD, the GitHub repo is still `quantum-ledger/QSD`,
  the binaries are still `QSD` / `QSDminer-console`, the import-time class is
  still `QSDClient`. Only the `npm install <name>` and `require()` strings
  pick up the `-sdk` suffix. The provenance attestation from the rejected
  publish attempt is preserved on Rekor at logIndex `1506312160` for audit.

## [0.3.0-attempt1] — 2026-05-10 (unpublished; see above)

Publish-ready release. No runtime API changes from `0.2.0`; this release adds
the metadata, packaging, and provenance machinery required for a clean npm
publish via the `sdk-javascript-publish` workflow.

### Added

- `repository`, `bugs`, `homepage` fields in `package.json` so the npm
  registry page links back to the canonical source.
- `exports` field with explicit `types` / `require` / `default` conditions so
  bundlers and modern Node resolvers pick up `QSD.d.ts` automatically.
- `publishConfig.provenance: true` so each release on npm carries a signed
  Sigstore attestation linking the published tarball to the GitHub Actions
  run that produced it.
- `prepublishOnly` script — `node --test QSD.test.js` runs as a pre-publish
  gate so a broken build cannot reach the registry.
- `LICENSE` (MIT) and `CHANGELOG.md` are now packaged in the tarball
  (`files` allowlist) so downstream consumers see attribution and history
  without needing to clone the monorepo.
- Expanded test suite (`QSD.test.js`): now exercises every public method —
  `getNodeStatus` (typed mapping), `getPeers`, `getNetworkTopology`,
  `getMetricsJSON`, `getMetricsPrometheus` (raw text), `getRecentTransactions`,
  `getTransaction`, `sendTransaction`, plus error paths (`isNotFound`,
  `isUnauthorized`), `setToken` / `setAPIKey` header injection, baseURL
  trailing-slash trim, and the per-request timeout.

### Changed

- License field corrected to `MIT` to match the monorepo `LICENSE` file
  (the previous `Apache-2.0` value was a copy-paste error from the Go SDK
  scaffolding window; no published release ever shipped with it).

## [0.2.0] — earlier (in-tree, unpublished)

Initial feature-parity rewrite covering every endpoint exposed by `sdk/go`:
context-style options (`fetch`, `timeoutMs`), `ApiError` class with
`isNotFound` / `isUnauthorized` helpers, baseURL trailing-slash trim, typed
`getNodeStatus` projection, and all wallet / health / network / metrics
endpoints.
