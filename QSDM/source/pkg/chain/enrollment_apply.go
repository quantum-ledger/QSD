package chain

// enrollment_apply.go: consensus-layer plumbing that routes
// "QSD/enroll/v1" transactions (mempool.Tx with
// ContractID == enrollment.ContractID) through
// pkg/mining/enrollment's validation + state transitions,
// coordinated with AccountStore balance debits and
// stake-release credits on sweep.
//
// Scope of this commit (Phase 2c-vi plumbing, NOT block-apply
// wiring yet):
//
//   - EnrollmentApplier struct with ApplyEnrollmentTx and
//     SweepMaturedEnrollments.
//   - Unit conversion between float64 CELL balances (the
//     pre-fork account store representation) and the uint64
//     dust units the enrollment model operates in.
//   - Atomic apply semantics: on any validation or state error
//     the receiver's AccountStore and EnrollmentState are
//     unchanged, so the caller can safely surface the error as
//     a block-receipt rejection without rolling back anything.
//
// Explicitly out of scope:
//
//   - No call site in bft_executor / BlockProducer yet. The
//     follow-on commit flips the switch by routing
//     ContractID-tagged txs through this adapter during block
//     finalisation. Keeping that change as a separate commit
//     makes the consensus-visible change easy to review in
//     isolation.
//
//   - No mempool admission gate yet. Stateless validation
//     (ValidateEnrollFields / ValidateUnenrollFields) can be
//     surfaced via pkg/chain.PoolValidator, but wiring that
//     belongs in the same commit that flips the apply path.
//
// Design notes:
//
//   - Unit bridging (balanceToDust / dustToBalance) is done
//     here rather than forcing the enrollment package to know
//     about float64, because pkg/mining/enrollment is meant to
//     survive the eventual migration to a uint64-only ledger
//     and should not carry pre-fork float semantics.
//
//   - The EnrollmentStateMutator interface is declared locally
//     so pkg/chain depends only on the methods it actually
//     uses; *enrollment.InMemoryState satisfies it through
//     structural typing without any changes to the enrollment
//     package.
