// Package chainparams implements the on-chain governance
// parameter-tuning surface for QSD v2.
//
// # Why this package exists
//
// Two protocol-economy parameters live as construction-time
// arguments to chain.SlashApplier today:
//
//   - RewardBPS: the slasher's reward share, in basis points
//     of the forfeited stake.
//   - AutoRevokeMinStakeDust: the threshold below which a
//     post-slash record is auto-revoked into the unbond window.
//
// To retune either, every validator has to swap binaries —
// which means coordinated downtime. This package introduces a
// `QSD/gov/v1` transaction type that lets a configured set of
// governance authorities retune them at runtime, with staged
// activation at a future block height so validators see the
// change coming.
//
// # Scope
//
// This is intentionally a small, surgical surface: a whitelist
// of tunable parameters with bounds, a ParamStore that
// SlashApplier reads from at apply time, and an admission /
// applier pair that mirrors the enrollment / slashing pattern.
// Anything more ambitious (governance-as-multisig-on-chain,
// arbitrary contract upgrades, treasury votes) is explicitly
// out of scope; pkg/governance/{voting,multisig} owns the off-
// chain proposal lifecycle and submits a `QSD/gov/v1` tx via
// the same path any other client would use, after collecting
// the required signatures.
//
// # Auth model
//
// `chain.GovApplier` is constructed with an `AuthorityList`
// slice of addresses. A `QSD/gov/v1` tx is accepted only if
// `tx.Sender` is on that list. An empty list disables on-chain
// governance entirely (every gov tx rejects with
// `ErrGovernanceNotConfigured`), which is the genesis posture
// for chains that have not yet bootstrapped a governance
// authority.
//
// The on-chain authority list is itself NOT governance-tunable
// in this revision — modifying it requires a binary upgrade
// or a chain-config reload. That's deliberate: a circular
// "governance can change the list of governors" would let a
// captured authority lock out the rest, which is the nightmare
// scenario for this kind of subsystem. Adding a multisig-gated
// authority-rotation tx is a follow-on once the basic surface
// is battle-tested.
