// Package archcheck implements the §4.6 / §3.3-step-8
// "arch-spoof rejection" cross-checks for v2 mining proofs.
//
// # Why this package exists
//
// The original protocol draft (MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md §4.6, pre
// 2026-04-29) said:
//
//	"the matmul rounding fingerprint differs"
//
// suggesting that the verifier could detect arch-spoof attempts
// (e.g. an RTX 4090 claiming to be an H100) by inspecting
// architecture-specific FP16 rounding differences in the
// Tensor-Core mix digest.
//
// That claim was wrong. The 2026-04-26 ratification of byte-exact
// FP16 round-to-nearest-even (`pkg/mining/pow/v2/fp16.go` +
// matmul accumulation order) DELIBERATELY locks the digest to be
// identical across every architecture that can run the spec.
// That is a conformance bar — without it, byte-exact validation
// across heterogeneous hardware would be impossible. So there
// IS no rounding-fingerprint to lean on.
//
// What we CAN do is what this package does: enforce
// out-of-band consistency between the proof's self-reported
// arch and the parts of the attestation surface the operator
// cannot freely swap without re-signing:
//
//  1. Closed-enum allowlist for Attestation.GPUArch. An unknown
//     arch string (typo, future-arch sneak attempt, garbage)
//     hard-rejects.
//
//  2. arch ↔ bundle.gpu_name consistency (HMAC path). The HMAC
//     bundle's gpu_name is HMAC-bound under the operator's
//     enrollment-time secret, so an attacker cannot post-hoc
//     swap it without resigning the bundle. This catches the
//     "lazy spoof" — an attacker who flips gpu_arch=hopper but
//     forgets to also lie about the nvidia-smi name on their
//     consumer Ada card. A determined attacker who lies about
//     BOTH is still trapped by the on-chain registry's
//     (gpu_uuid, hmac_key) pairing — and economically by the
//     §5.4 stake bond plus §8 slashing surface.
//
// # Aliases
//
// The codebase ships with both `"ada"` and `"ada-lovelace"`
// in flight (QSDminer-console emits the short form, the
// protocol doc shows the long form, the test suite uses both).
// To avoid a flag-day cutover, this package accepts BOTH and
// canonicalises to the long form internally. `Canonicalise()`
// is the single source of truth callers use; the validator
// then matches against the canonical name.
//
// # CC-path cert subject check
//
// The CC path has its own consistency function,
// ValidateBundleArchConsistencyCC, that mirrors the HMAC
// gpu_name idea but evidence-based: if the leaf cert's Subject
// (e.g. CommonName) mentions a known NVIDIA product, the
// claimed arch must match the longest-matching pattern; if the
// Subject is opaque (test-only CN, corporate label, OID-based
// model encoding) we pass through and let the cert-chain pin +
// AIK signature carry the cryptographic guarantee. See the
// function's doc-comment for the full design rationale and
// MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md §4.6.5 for the spec text.
//
// # Hashrate-band plausibility
//
// `Attestation.ClaimedHashrateHPS` is operator-supplied and
// ungated by any cryptographic check — the miner can put any
// number they want there. It feeds the leaderboard / pool
// telemetry surface, not consensus, so the worst case is
// reputational manipulation rather than block-acceptance
// manipulation. Even so, an obviously-implausible value is a
// strong signal that the rest of the attestation is suspect:
//
//   - A claimed 100 MH/s on `gpu_arch=turing` (T4 peaks ~0.5
//     MH/s for the v2 mixin) almost certainly means the
//     miner is lying about something.
//   - A claimed 0.05 MH/s on `gpu_arch=hopper` (H100 should be
//     ~20-40 MH/s) suggests CPU mining with a forged
//     attestation.
//
// Bounds are intentionally GENEROUS (≈100x range per arch)
// so legitimate variation across a product family doesn't
// trip false positives. The check rejects only the obvious
// lies; subtler manipulation is left to off-chain analysis.
// `ClaimedHashrateHPS == 0` is treated as "not asserted" and
// passes through — see `ValidateClaimedHashrate` for why.

// empty value is itself a rejection signal — the CC path's
// device certificate Subject does NOT have a universally fixed
// shape. NVIDIA's production CC chains may encode the GPU

//
//   - Subject.CommonName as a free-form product string
//     ("NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3"), OR
//   - Subject.OrganizationalUnit (less common), OR
//   - A custom OID extension we do not yet parse, OR
//   - Nowhere on the leaf at all (the model is only inferable
//     from the issuing intermediate's name).
//
// We DON'T know which shape the production NVIDIA chain uses
// until we have a real fixture, and we don't want a strict
// "must contain a known product string" rule to false-reject
// honest validators because their cert format doesn't include
// the model in CN. So this function uses an EVIDENCE-BASED
// rule:
//
//  1. Normalise the candidate subject string (lowercase,
//     collapse whitespace; the same shape as the HMAC path's
//     normaliseGPUName).
//  2. Scan the normalised string for ANY product substring
//     across ALL canonical architectures.
//
//     - If NONE found: the cert subject contains no product
//       evidence. Pass through. The cert chain root pin
//       (§3.2 step 3) and the AIK signature (§3.2 step 4)
//       remain the cryptographic locks; this layer is
//       supplementary soft verification.
//
//     - If at least one found: the cert subject is making a
//       positive claim about the hardware. Verify the
//       evidence is consistent with `arch`. Returns
//       ErrArchCertSubjectMismatch on contradiction.
//
// # Why this isn't a backdoor
//
// "Pass through on no evidence" sounds like a free pass for an
// attacker who controls the cert content. It is not, because
// step 3 (cert chain rooted in pinned NVIDIA CA) means the
// attacker cannot mint a leaf at all unless they ALREADY have
// an NVIDIA-issued AIK — which is bound to a specific physical
// device by NVIDIA's manufacturing process. So the worst case
// here is an honest leaf whose CN happens to be opaque, which
// we accept; the attacker shape "spoof an arch with a
// fabricated leaf" is locked out one layer up.
//
// # Why we reuse the HMAC patterns
//
// The substring patterns are the same NVIDIA product strings
// nvidia-smi emits and the same strings any reasonable cert
// subject would carry — there's no need to maintain a second
// table. Both paths therefore stay consistent in what they
// consider "evidence of arch X".

// or join CN + OU once we have real fixtures showing where the
