// This file defines the compile-time constants and runtime-settable
// fork height that govern the v2 ("NVIDIA-locked") upgrade of the
// mining sub-protocol. The full spec is
// QSD/docs/docs/MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md; the three parameter values
// below are ratified in §13 of that doc (2026-04-24 owner sign-off).
//
// Phase 2 of the pivot (this file is part of it) introduces v2 as
// a compile-time concept only — ForkV2Height defaults to
// math.MaxUint64, so no proof is ever routed through the v2 gate
// until a later activation step (Phase 4 genesis-reset) calls
// SetForkV2Height with the real activation block number.
//
// Why a runtime-settable gate rather than another const: fork
// heights are per-network configuration (testnet vs mainnet; local
// integration-test chains that activate v2 at height 0). Making it
// a package-level atomic lets unit tests exercise v2 code paths
// without having to recompile the package and without leaking test
// state across concurrent t.Parallel() runs.

// ProtocolVersionV2 is the Proof.Version value for the NVIDIA-locked
// upgrade. v1 (= ProtocolVersion, declared in doc.go) remains the
// value Proof.Version is checked against for heights below
// ForkV2Height. At or above ForkV2Height validators switch to this
// value and additionally enforce the mandatory-attestation rules of
// MINING_PROTOCOL_V2 §3 and §7.
//
// Bumping this is a hard fork; see MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md §1 for
// the full list of consensus-visible changes it implies.

// FreshnessWindow is the maximum age of an attestation nonce
// (MINING_PROTOCOL_V2 §6.2). A proof whose Attestation.IssuedAt is
// more than FreshnessWindow before the validator's wall clock is
// rejected with ReasonAttestationStale. The validator's nonce
// ring-buffer retains issued nonces for 2*FreshnessWindow so
// double-spend of the same challenge is also detectable.
//
// 60 seconds balances replay resistance (tight enough that a
// replayed bundle becomes invalid within one block-production
// cycle) against false-positive rejection (loose enough that a
// miner on a slow residential link can fetch, compute, and submit
// without flickering in and out of staleness).

// in a uint64 without any floating-point conversion.
//
// 10 CELL is the ratified initial value (2026-04-24). Governance
// can adjust post-launch via the chain-config delta mechanism of

// every miner to upgrade to compatible hardware/firmware, the
// former does not.
//
// Both heights default to math.MaxUint64.
//
// SetForkV2Height is intended to be called at chain-init time only.
// SetForkV2TCHeight, by contrast, is ALSO called from the governance
// SealedBlockHook (see internal/v2wiring) after each Promote so a
// `QSD/gov/v1` param-set transaction can move the activation height
// at runtime. Governance is gated by the chain's M-of-N AuthorityList
// and stateless admission validators, so "moveable at runtime" does
// NOT mean "movable in response to adversarial input": a captured
// single authority cannot move the fork; the threshold is enforced by
// pkg/governance/chainparams + pkg/chain/gov_apply.go.
//
// The TC fork is a soft-tightening fork: pre-TC validators accept v1

// format is unchanged (Proof.MixDigest is still 32 bytes), no hard

// commit that adds this interface) ships FailClosedVerifier as
// the default — it rejects every v2 proof so that a misconfigured
// validator that forgets to wire in a real verifier fails safely
// rather than silently accepting anything.
//
// Implementations MUST be safe for concurrent use: a single
// AttestationVerifier instance is shared across all validator
// goroutines processing proofs.

	// nvidia-cc-v1 or nvidia-hmac-v1 verification flow described
	// in MINING_PROTOCOL_V2 §3.2. A nil return means "attested";

// The rationale for fail-closed over fail-open is MINING_PROTOCOL_V2
