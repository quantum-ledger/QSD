// Package freshnesscheat implements the EvidenceVerifier for
// slashing.EvidenceKindFreshnessCheat — the third and final
// member of the v2 slashing trilogy.
//
// # The offence
//
// A freshness-cheat is the canonical "validator collusion or
// clock skew" case: an enrolled operator's mining Proof was
// **accepted** on-chain even though its attestation
// `bundle.IssuedAt` falls outside the protocol's freshness
// window relative to the chain's wall-clock anchor at acceptance
// time. In a well-behaved network this never happens — the
// attestation verifier (`pkg/mining/attest/hmac`) rejects stale
// proofs synchronously. The offence therefore implies one of:
//
//   - A validator that ran a tampered binary (suppressed the
//     freshness check).
//   - A validator whose system clock is meaningfully off from
//     the rest of the network's consensus time.
//   - An operator who exploited a real bug in the attestation
//     verifier and managed to land a stale proof anyway.
//
// All three cases are slashable: the operator collected a
// reward they should not have. The submitter of the slash —
// any peer — re-runs the verification deterministically against
// a witness statement of "this proof was on-chain at height H,
// and at H the chain's wall-clock anchor was T".
//
// # The BFT-finality dependency
//
// The verifier needs a *trusted* `(Height, BlockTime)` pair,
// because that's the chain-side observation the offence is
// proven against. Without BFT finality (or an equivalent
// quorum-attested block-header feed) there is no chain-internal
// way to authenticate such a pair.
//
// Rather than ship `freshness-cheat` as a permanent stub
// (`StubVerifier`, always-reject), this package defines a
// `BlockInclusionWitness` interface that callers wire to
// whatever observability layer they have:
//
//   - In production today: `RejectAllWitness` — every slash of
//     this kind is rejected with a kind-specific
//     `ErrEvidenceVerification` ("witness layer not configured")
//     so operators see exactly what's missing instead of the
//     generic stub error. Same end-user behavior as the previous
//     `StubVerifier{K: EvidenceKindFreshnessCheat}` but with
//     better diagnostics.
//   - On testnets / dev: `TrustingTestWitness` — accepts every
//     anchor at face value. Lets the slashing path run end-to-
//     end so bugs surface before mainnet.
//   - When BFT finality lands: a real `quorum.HeaderWitness` (or
//     similar) plugs in here and freshness-cheat starts slashing
//     for real, with no changes elsewhere in this package.
//
// See MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md §8.2 (slashing-table row) and §12.3
// (deferred-work register) for the spec posture.

// Contract:
//
//   - Pure: implementations MUST NOT do I/O, sleep, or mutate
//     external state during VerifyAnchor. The whole verifier
//     runs on the consensus-apply path and must be byte-
//     deterministic across all validators.
//   - Idempotent: repeated calls with the same arguments MUST
//     return the same result.
//   - Fail-closed: ambiguous or unsupported anchors MUST return
//     an error wrapping `ErrAnchorUnverified`. A nil error means
//     "every validator running this binary will agree this
//     anchor is real".
//
// Implementations MAY be stateful internally (e.g. an in-memory
// index of finalised block headers populated by an upstream BFT
// pipeline), as long as the externally-observable behaviour
// satisfies the contract above.
