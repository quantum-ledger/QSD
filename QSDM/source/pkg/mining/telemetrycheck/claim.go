// Package telemetrycheck implements the Tier-2 advisory layer
// of the QSD Reference Telemetry Oracle. The Oracle (see
// pkg/telemetry) publishes signed reference profiles of what
// real GPUs report to nvidia-smi; this package CONSUMES those
// profiles and uses them to scrutinise miners' claimed GPU
// specs at proof-acceptance time.
//
// IMPORTANT: This package is non-consensus by design.
// Verdicts surface as logs, /metrics counters, and a public
// /api/v1/mining/spec-anomalies endpoint — they do NOT cause
// proof rejection. Tier-3 enforcement (downgrade reward tier
// on persistent mismatch) is left to a separate package so a
// bug here can never tank the chain.
//
// Design separation:
//
//   pkg/telemetry          — publishes reference data
//   pkg/mining/telemetrycheck — compares claims vs reference
//   internal/v2wiring      — bootstraps the catalog at validator boot
//   internal/miningsvc     — connects the checker to proof acceptance
//
// What gets checked (all advisory):
//
//   1. GPU name presence: bundle.gpu_name should appear in
//      at least one catalog entry. If not → "unknown_sku"
//      (this is normal during early operation when the
//      catalog has not yet seen this hardware).
//   2. Compute capability consistency: the (gpu_name,
//      compute_cap) pair must agree with at least one
//      catalog entry. A "RTX 3050 with CC 9.0" claim flags
//      because no real 3050 reports CC 9.0.
//   3. Architecture consistency: the outer Attestation.GPUArch
//      ("ampere", "hopper", etc.) must be derivable from the
//      compute_cap the bundle reports. A "ampere" claim with
//      compute_cap 9.0 (Hopper) is impossible.
//   4. Driver version sanity: when the catalog has driver
//      versions for this SKU, the bundle's driver_ver should
//      either match an observed version or look like a
//      plausible same-family version (e.g. starts with the
//      same major). Today: weak check (just "vendor format" —
//      digits + dots), not a hard match, because driver
//      releases ship faster than the catalog observes them.
//
// What is NOT checked here (left for Tier-3 / future):
//
//   - Memory size, TDP, PCIe gen — these depend on bundle
//     extension fields the v1 hmac bundle does not carry.
//     Adding them to the bundle is a forward-compatible
//     change that lands in a follow-up commit.
//   - Live benchmark fingerprints. Requires the validator
//     to challenge the miner with a canonical kernel and
//     compare timing distributions; that's its own protocol.
//
// Concurrency: Catalog and Checker are safe for concurrent
// reads. Catalog mutation (Apply / Replace) is gated by an
// internal mutex; the checker holds only RLocks during
// Check, so a steady-state load + sporadic refresh is the
// expected workload pattern.
