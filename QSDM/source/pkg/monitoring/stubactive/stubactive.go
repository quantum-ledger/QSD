// Package stubactive is the registry of which stub-shipped code
// paths are currently active in the running binary. It exists
// because QSD intentionally ships several stubs that are
// runtime-selectable or build-tag-selectable and are NOT safe in
// production.
//
// Current state of each kind (last reviewed 2026-05-06, after
// Stage A wazero / Stage B circl):
//
//   - "poe"          — RETIRED. pkg/consensus/poe_stub.go was
//                      deleted in Stage B (commit c2598d5);
//                      pkg/consensus/poe.go now compiles
//                      unconditionally and supplies a real
//                      verifier in every build. Kind is kept
//                      in AllKinds() for forward compatibility
//                      with rolling deploys, but no in-tree
//                      code path flips it on.
//   - "dilithium"    — RETIRED. pkg/crypto/dilithium_stub.go
//                      was deleted in Stage B; the !cgo path
//                      now uses pkg/crypto/dilithium_circl.go
//                      (cloudflare/circl pure-Go ML-DSA-87,
//                      FIPS 204 wire-compatible with liboqs).
//   - "wallet"       — RETIRED. pkg/wallet/wallet_stub.go was
//                      deleted in Stage B; pkg/wallet/wallet.go
//                      compiles unconditionally and the SHA-256
//                      fallback signer is gone.
//   - "slashing"     — RETIRED. internal/v2wiring uses
//                      freshnesscheat.NewProductionSlashingDispatcher
//                      which registers a real EvidenceVerifier
//                      for every EvidenceKind (no StubVerifier
//                      fallback in production wiring).
//   - "wasm_sdk"     — RETIRED. pkg/wasm/sdk_stub.go and
//                      pkg/wasm/sdk_wasmtime_disabled.go were
//                      deleted in wasm Stage B (2026-05-06);
//                      pkg/wasm/sdk_wazero.go (build tag
//                      `!js || !wasm`) is now the
//                      unconditional default backed by
//                      tetratelabs/wazero pure-Go. The
//                      wasm_wazero tag from Stage A is a no-op
//                      alias retained for one release for
//                      compat with external build scripts.
//   - "mesh3d_cuda"  — UNCHANGED. pkg/mesh3d/cuda_stub.go (no
//                      CUDA toolkit / drivers); CPU fallback
//                      validator runs in its place and is
//                      structurally complete. Real GPU
//                      acceleration requires NVIDIA hardware.
//   - "cc"           — UNCHANGED. pkg/mining/attest/cc/stub.go
//                      (Phase 2c-iv pending). Rejects every
//                      nvidia-cc-v1 proof with
//                      ErrNotYetAvailable. Real implementation
//                      requires the NVIDIA Confidential
//                      Computing SDK and an H100/H200 GPU on
//                      the verifier side.
//
// Why a separate leaf package instead of a value in pkg/monitoring?
//
// Stubs live in dependency-graph-leaves like pkg/consensus and
// pkg/crypto; pkg/monitoring depends on pkg/mining and pkg/chain,
// which would create import cycles if stubs imported it directly.
// stubactive has zero non-stdlib imports, so any stub file can
// import it freely. pkg/monitoring then reads the snapshot to
// emit the QSD_stub_active{kind="..."} Prometheus gauge.
//
// Concurrency: the registry is a sync.Map under the hood;
// MarkActive/MarkInactive are safe to call from package init()
// or runtime constructors, and Snapshot is safe to call from
// the metrics-scrape goroutine while marks happen.
