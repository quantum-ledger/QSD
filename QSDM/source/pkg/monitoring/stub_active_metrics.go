package monitoring

// Stub-active metrics: bridges the leaf pkg/monitoring/stubactive
// registry into the OpenMetrics scrape surface as
// QSD_stub_active{kind="..."}.
//
// Why a bridge instead of stubactive owning the metric directly?
// stubactive is a leaf package with zero external imports so any
// stub file (in pkg/consensus, pkg/crypto, pkg/wallet, …) can
// import it without creating an import cycle through the
// monitoring → mining → consensus chain. The metric exposition
// itself uses pkg/monitoring's own Metric type, so it lives here.
//
// The gauge surfaces every kind in stubactive.AllKinds() on
// every scrape (value 0 or 1) so the alerting expression
// `QSD_stub_active == 1` evaluates against a populated time
// series rather than missing-data — a "Stub active for kind X"
// alert that depends on a metric appearing only AFTER the stub
// is loaded has the obvious bootstrap problem (the alert can't
// fire if the metric was never created).
