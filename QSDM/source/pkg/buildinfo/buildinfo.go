// Package buildinfo exposes build-time metadata (semver tag, git commit
// SHA, build timestamp) that release artefacts can embed via
// `-ldflags -X`. Every cmd/ main that ships as a signed release
// artefact reads these vars through a --version flag so bug reports
// carry a precise commit + release identifier.
//
// Default values ("dev" / "unknown") mean the binary was built outside
// the release pipeline (`go run`, `go build` without flags). That is
// valid and expected for local development; CI gates never rely on
// these strings, only human operators do.
//
// Release-time injection from .github/workflows/release-container.yml:
//
//	go build \
//	  -trimpath \
//	  -ldflags "-s -w \
//	    -X github.com/blackbeardONE/QSD/pkg/buildinfo.Version=v0.1.0 \
//	    -X github.com/blackbeardONE/QSD/pkg/buildinfo.GitSHA=abc1234 \
//	    -X github.com/blackbeardONE/QSD/pkg/buildinfo.BuildDate=2026-04-22T10:00:00Z" \
//	  ./cmd/QSDminer-console
//
// With that, `QSDminer-console --version` prints:
//
//	QSDminer-console v0.1.0 (abc1234, 2026-04-22T10:00:00Z, go1.25.9, linux/amd64)
//
// Operators can map the semver to the GitHub Release page and the SHA
// to a commit on main, which is the minimum metadata needed to triage
// an incident against a specific artefact.
