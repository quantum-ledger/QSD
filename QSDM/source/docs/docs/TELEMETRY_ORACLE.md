## What is this for?

The QSD v2 protocol locks proof submission to NVIDIA GPUs.
Today, the validator can verify that a proof was signed by
an enrolled HMAC key — but it has **no ground truth** for
what the operator's hardware actually is. A miner can claim
they are running an RTX 3050 (Ampere, CC 8.6, 8 GB GDDR6) and
the validator simply has to trust the claim.

The Reference Telemetry Oracle solves that the way real
networks have always solved it: **operators we trust publish
what their hardware looks like, and other operators use that
data as a sanity-check substrate**. It does not (yet) reject
spoofed claims. It builds the catalog. Once enough operators
have published profiles for enough SKUs over enough time, the
network has a credible reference set to compare incoming
miner claims against — and at that point, validators can
start downgrading or rejecting impossible claims (e.g.
"RTX 3050 with 24 GB" or "H100 with 130W TDP").

> **Active downstream:** The validator-side **Tier-2 advisory
> checker** (`pkg/mining/telemetrycheck`) already consumes
> these profiles. It compares each accepted v2 proof's
> claimed GPU specs against the catalog and surfaces
> mismatches at `/api/v1/mining/spec-anomalies` and the
> `QSD_spec_check_*` Prometheus counters. **Advisory
> only** — no rejection, no reward effect (yet). See
> [SPEC_ANOMALY_CHECK.md](SPEC_ANOMALY_CHECK.md) for the
> full design.

The oracle runs **inside the same `QSD-attester` binary**
that issues challenges. One process, two roles, one HMAC key.

### What the fields mean

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | int | Always `1` today. Bumped only on breaking changes; additive changes keep `1`. |
| `signer_id` | string | The attester's HMAC signer ID — same one it uses on `/api/v1/mining/challenge`. |
| `host_note` | string | Operator-supplied free-form tag (`--telemetry-note`). Defaults to the attester's `--note`. |
| `collector_kind` | string | Today always `"nvidia-smi"`. Future: `"nvml-attestation"`, `"rocm-smi"`, `"spdm"`. Verifiers may weight profiles by source. |
| `issued_at` | int64 (unix sec) | Re-stamped on every request — not cached. |
| `gpus[]` | array | One entry per physical GPU the attester has ever observed. |
| `gpus[].uuid` | string | NVIDIA GPU UUID. Identity key inside the profile. |
| `gpus[].arch` | string | Inferred from compute capability. `ampere`, `ada-lovelace`, `hopper`, etc. Empty for unknown future generations. |
| `gpus[].memory_total_mb` | uint64 | What the device reports, in MiB (1024×1024). Marketing GB ≠ MiB. |
| `gpus[].pcie_gen` / `pcie_width` | uint8 | Maximum negotiable PCIe gen + lane width. |
| `gpus[].power_max_w` | float | TDP cap in watts. SKU-stable; operator BIOS overrides can shift this. |
| `gpus[].ecc_supported` | bool | True if the device supports ECC memory (datacenter cards). False for consumer cards. |
| `gpus[].clock_graphics_boost_mhz` | uint32 | Maximum graphics clock (boost) — SKU-stable. NOT current clock. |
| `gpus[].clock_memory_mhz` | uint32 | Maximum memory clock — SKU-stable. |
| `gpus[].driver_versions_seen` | []string | Union of distinct driver versions observed across the attester's lifetime. |
| `gpus[].vbios_versions_seen` | []string | Same idea for VBIOS revisions. |
| `gpus[].first_observed_at` / `last_observed_at` | int64 | Lifetime bounds for this UUID on this attester. |
| `gpus[].observations` | uint64 | Cumulative `Apply()` count. Longevity signal. |
| `signature` | hex | HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical encoding of every other field. See "Verifying" below. |

## Query parameters

```
GET /api/v1/telemetry/reference?gpu=<uuid>
```
Filter to a single GPU. The profile is **re-signed** after
the filter pass, so the signature you get back is over the
slimmed-down body — verifiers always validate against
exactly the bytes they received.

```
GET /api/v1/telemetry/reference?include_observations=N
```
Cap each per-GPU `*VersionsSeen` set to at most `N`
entries. Useful for operators who have accumulated a
long history but want to publish a compact summary.
Re-signed after capping.

Both knobs can be combined.

## Verifying a profile

The signature is `HMAC_SHA256(canonical_bytes, hmac_key)`
where:

1. `canonical_bytes` is `json.Marshal` of the profile with:
   - `Signature` cleared to `""`
   - `gpus[]` sorted by `uuid` ascending
   - `driver_versions_seen` / `cuda_versions_seen` /
     `vbios_versions_seen` sorted lexicographically
2. `hmac_key` is the SAME key the attester uses to sign
   challenges (the operator pasted both into the
   verifier's allowlist).

A reference verifier in Go is in `pkg/telemetry/profile.go`
(`(*ReferenceProfile).Verify(key)`). Operators of other
languages should mirror the canonical encoding rules above.

## How collection works on the attester

- Boot: load existing profile from
  `~/.QSD/telemetry.json` if it exists. Past observations
  carry forward across restarts.
- Boot+1: run one Collect immediately so a fresh boot
  picks up new driver versions without waiting a full
  tick.
- Every `--telemetry-every` (default 60s): run
  `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=...` and fold the result into
  the registry. Persist atomically to disk.
- Every request to `/api/v1/telemetry/reference`:
  build a fresh snapshot of the registry, sign with the
  signer key, return.

The collector goroutine and the HTTP handler share the
registry through a single `sync.RWMutex`; concurrent
reads (HTTP) and writes (collector) cannot tear.

### What `nvidia-smi` is queried for

```
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=
  uuid,name,compute_cap,memory.total,driver_version,
  pcie.link.gen.max,pcie.link.width.max,power.max_limit,
  vbios_version,ecc.mode.current,clocks.max.gr,clocks.max.mem
  --format=csv,noheader,nounits
```

`clocks.max.gr` / `clocks.max.mem` (NOT `clocks.gr` /
`clocks.mem`) are the maximum boost clocks. Querying the
current clocks would publish an idle state and the profile
would jitter every tick.

## Flags

```
--telemetry-disabled           Disable the oracle entirely.
--telemetry-every 60s          Collector tick interval.
--telemetry-file PATH          Persistence path.
                               '-' = no persistence.
                               '' = ~/.QSD/telemetry.json.
--telemetry-note STRING        host_note in the published profile.
                               Defaults to the attester --note.
--telemetry-nvidia-smi PATH    Override nvidia-smi binary.
```

## Observability

`/info`:
```json
{ "telemetry_enabled": true, "telemetry_gpus": 1, "telemetry_ticks": 3 }
```

`/metrics` (Prometheus text format):
```
QSD_attester_telemetry_gpus
QSD_attester_telemetry_collection_ticks_total
QSD_attester_telemetry_collection_errors_total
QSD_attester_telemetry_apply_calls_total
QSD_attester_telemetry_requests_total
QSD_attester_telemetry_sign_failures_total
```

When telemetry is disabled, the `QSD_attester_telemetry_*`
counters are absent (not zero). A scrape that suddenly stops
seeing them is a positive disable signal, not a metric drop.

## Threat model

- **Forging an attester signature**: requires the HMAC key.
  Same key that signs challenges, so the same
  attestation-chain trust applies.
- **Lying about hardware**: an honest attester can publish
  a faked profile if the operator wants to. The profile
  signature only proves "this attester said this", not
  "this hardware exists". Cross-checks with peer
  attesters' profiles for the same SKU are the network's
  defense — anomalies surface as outliers, not as
  cryptographic failures.
- **Replay across attesters**: the signature binds
  `signer_id`, so a profile signed by attester A cannot be
  republished as if it were attester B's catalog without
  A's key.
- **Stale data**: `issued_at` is freshly stamped at request
  time. Verifiers SHOULD reject profiles older than some
  operator-chosen threshold; the catalog itself is content
  with old observations as long as the issuance is recent.

## What the network does NOT do (yet)

- Reject miner submissions for spec mismatches against the
  catalog. That comes once we have ≥10 attesters publishing
  for ≥3 SKUs each, so a spoofing detector can ground its
  decisions in real distributions instead of single-attester
  data.
- Aggregate profiles across attesters into a global
  catalog. The validator currently treats each profile as
  independent. A future `/api/v1/telemetry/profiles`
  catalog endpoint can roll them up.

## Roadmap

| Tier | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Static spec catalog (this doc) | Shipped. |
| 2 | Validator-side advisory check (warn on mismatch) | Shipped. |
| 3 | Validator-side enforcement (downgrade reward on persistent mismatch) | Shipped. See `SPEC_ANOMALY_CHECK.md` §"Tier-3 reward downgrade". |
| 4 | Live benchmark fingerprints (timing distributions for canonical kernels) | Independent of 2/3. |
| 5 | Aggregator endpoint at `/api/v1/telemetry/profiles` | Independent of 2/3. |

## Per-attester key pinning (validator side)

The Tier-2/3 catalog refresh path is only as trustworthy as
the attester URLs the validator polls. Without verification a
relay operator (or anyone in a position to MITM the HTTPS
connection between validator and attester) could forge a
profile and silently poison the SKU catalog. The validator
closes this gap with **per-attester key pinning**.

### How it works

The attester signs every profile with its 32-byte HMAC key
(`~/.QSD/attester.key`). The validator can be configured
with a list of `(signer_id, key)` pairs it trusts:

| Env var | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_KEYS` | `signer_id=<64 hex>;signer_id=<64 hex>` | Inline. Ergonomic for 1–2 pins. |
| `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_KEYS_FILE` | path | One `signer_id=<64 hex>` per line; `#` comments. Use this when the list is too long for a systemd `Environment=` line, or when you want stricter file-system permissions on the secret. |
| `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_STRICT` | `1` (default if any pin loaded) / `0` | When strict, profiles whose `signer_id` is NOT in the pin list are dropped. When non-strict, unknown signers are accepted with a warning — useful during rollout. |
| `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_MAX_AGE` | duration literal (`1h`, `30m`) or bare seconds (`3600`) or `0` to disable | Freshness window. A profile whose `IssuedAt` is older than `now − max_age − skew` is rejected even if its signature is valid (defends against profile **replay**). Defaults to `1h` once any pin is loaded. `0` disables the gate explicitly. |
| `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_SKEW` | duration / bare seconds / `0` | Symmetric clock-skew grace window. Profiles signed up to this far in the future are accepted; the past-side cutoff is also extended by this much. Defaults to `5m`. |

When **at least one pin** is loaded, the verification gate
runs on every fetched profile (boot + periodic poll). The
decision tree (in order — first match wins):

| # | Profile state | Outcome | Counter |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Signed but `signer_id` unknown, `strict=1` | Rejected | `rejected_unknown_signer` |
| 2 | Pinned `signer_id` but `signature` empty | Rejected (NEVER accept unsigned when ANY pin is configured — that would let an attacker bypass the check by stripping the field) | `rejected_unsigned` |
| 3 | Pinned `signer_id` but signature does not verify | Rejected | `rejected_bad_signature` |
| 4 | `IssuedAt > now + skew` (far-future-dated) AND `max_age > 0` | Rejected | `rejected_stale` |
| 5 | `IssuedAt < now − max_age − skew` (replay) AND `max_age > 0` | Rejected | `rejected_stale` |
| 6 | All gates passed, signed by a pinned key | Accepted, applied to catalog | `accepted_signed` |
| 7 | All gates passed, signer_id unknown (strict=0 or no pins loaded) | Accepted with warning | `accepted_unpinned` |

The signature gate runs **before** the freshness gate so a
forged-but-fresh profile is reported as `rejected_bad_signature`,
not `rejected_stale` — operators reading the metric stream
get the right error label for debugging.

The freshness gate runs **independently** of pinning: an
operator who wants replay protection but not signature
pinning can set `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_MAX_AGE` directly via
`SetMaxAge`-equivalent path… though in practice the env
loader only resolves `MAX_AGE` when at least one pin is
configured, so the typical posture is "all on or all off".

When **no pin is loaded**, the gate is bypassed — all
fetched profiles are accepted, and a single
`spec-check: peer-attester key pinning DISABLED` log line
is emitted at boot so the operator notices.

### Prometheus

| Metric | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `QSD_spec_check_peer_keys_pinned` | gauge | Number of pins loaded. `0` = pinning off. |
| `QSD_spec_check_peer_keys_strict` | gauge | `1` when strict mode is on. |
| `QSD_spec_check_peer_profile_max_age_seconds` | gauge | Resolved freshness window. `0` = freshness gate disabled. |
| `QSD_spec_check_peer_profile_signature_total{result="..."}` | counter | One series per outcome label: `accepted_signed`, `accepted_unpinned`, `rejected_unknown_signer`, `rejected_unsigned`, `rejected_bad_signature`, `rejected_stale`. Use this to alert on spikes in any `rejected_*`. |

### Operational notes

- HMAC is symmetric: the same 32 bytes the attester uses to
  sign are what the validator pins. The operator therefore
  has to copy the attester's `attester.key` (or its hex
  encoding) onto every validator that wants to trust it.
- A future revision can swap the wire signature to
  Ed25519 (asymmetric) without changing the pinning
  contract — the registry would load public keys instead
  of shared secrets, the rest of the pipeline unchanged.
- File-system advice for `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_KEYS_FILE`:
  put the file at `/etc/QSD/peer-attester-keys.txt`,
  `chown root:<service-user>`, `chmod 640`. Permissions
  must let the validator's service user read the file
  but nobody else.
- Rotation: when an attester rotates its key, every
  pinning validator must update its config simultaneously.
  This is the correct posture — silent acceptance of an
  un-coordinated key change would defeat the threat model.
- **Freshness vs signature: orthogonal concerns.** Pinning
  defends against forged content; freshness defends against
  stale content (legitimately signed but old). An attacker
  who once captured a signed profile via packet inspection
  can serve it forever without freshness — pinning alone
  does not stop this. Together they cover the full
  "what + when" trust surface.
- **Tuning the freshness window.** Default `1h` comfortably
  fits the 5-minute polling interval plus several missed
  polls. Tighter windows (`5m`–`10m`) detect replays
  faster but punish attesters that briefly go offline.
  Looser windows (`24h`+) are useful for weekly-refresh
  static catalogs where the data legitimately ages slowly.
- **Tuning skew.** The default `5m` is the right choice
  for boxes that may not run NTP. If you DO run NTP and
  want maximum tightness, set `QSD_PEER_ATTESTER_SKEW=0`;
  the validator will then reject ANY future-dated profile
  and any profile older than exactly `max_age`.

## Wiring it into your own attester

Your attester already publishes the oracle by default — no
extra steps. To verify locally before exposing it:

```powershell
# Check enabled
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:7733/info | ConvertTo-Json
# Get the signed profile
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:7733/api/v1/telemetry/reference | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
```

To disable:

```powershell
.\QSD-attester.exe --telemetry-disabled
```

To verify externally via the tunnel:

```bash
curl https://api.QSD.tech/attest/<your-slot>/api/v1/telemetry/reference
```

## Programmatic verification (Go)

```go
import "github.com/blackbeardONE/QSD/pkg/telemetry"

raw, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
var p telemetry.ReferenceProfile
_ = json.Unmarshal(raw, &p)
if err := p.Validate(); err != nil { /* malformed */ }
if !p.Verify(operatorKey) { /* signature mismatch */ }
// Inspect p.GPUs[*] for static specs.
```
