# `genesis-ceremony` — DRY-RUN of the QSD mainnet genesis ceremony

> **This binary does not produce real genesis allocations.** Every artefact
> it emits carries `"dry_run": true` at the top level, and the verifier
> refuses to bless any bundle where that flag is false. It exists so
> validator operators, auditors, and counsel (`tok-01`) can inspect a
> realistic ceremony artefact before mainnet.

## What the ceremony does

N participants run an N-of-N commit-reveal randomness beacon:

1. Each participant generates a fresh keypair and a 32-byte secret
   `reveal`.
2. Each participant publishes `sha3-256(reveal)` as their *commit*
   (revealing nothing yet).
3. Once all commits are in, every participant publishes their `reveal`.
4. The genesis seed is `sha3-256(concat(reveals in ID order))`.
5. Every participant signs the canonical genesis hash
   (`hash(ceremony_id || network || treasury_addr || commit_root ||
   genesis_seed || params)`) with their private key.
6. The final bundle is the concatenation of commits, reveals, the seed,
   and every signature.

Anyone with the bundle can:

- Recompute each commit from its reveal.
- Recompute the genesis seed and genesis hash.
- Verify every signature against each participant's published pubkey.
- Confirm the tokenomics invariant
  `TotalSupplyCell == TreasuryAllocationCell + MiningEmissionCell`.

Run `genesis-ceremony -mode verify -in bundle.json` to execute all of
the above in one step.

## Differences from the production ceremony

| Surface | Dry-run | Production |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Signing | ed25519 (stdlib) | ML-DSA-87 via liboqs (matches validator signing) |
| Phases | single round commit→reveal | commit → timelock-encrypted reveal → open |
| Participant set | synthetic `participant-01 .. -NN` | on-chain validator set at snapshot height |
| Private keys | generated ephemerally in one process | generated on air-gapped hardware per participant |
| Anchoring | bundle JSON only | bundle hash pinned in genesis block |
| Audit trail | local `--out` file | co-published to GHCR, IPFS, and foundation archive |

The production ceremony driver is a separate binary. When it lands, it
will share this binary's canonical serialization shape (§Bundle shape
below) so any tooling written against dry-run bundles continues to work.

## Usage

### Run

```powershell
# from QSD/source/
go build -o genesis.exe ./cmd/genesis-ceremony
.\genesis.exe -mode run -participants 7 -network QSD-dryrun -out bundle.json
```

Output (`bundle.json`) is a pretty-printed JSON blob suitable for `jq`
and for checking into public archives during a ceremony rehearsal.

### Verify

```powershell
.\genesis.exe -mode verify -in bundle.json
# genesis-ceremony: verify OK (ceremony_id=..., 7 participants, seed=...)
```

Verification fails (exit code 2) on any of:

- tampered commit / reveal / signature
- participant list not in ID order
- `TotalSupplyCell != TreasuryAllocationCell + MiningEmissionCell`
- schema version drift
- `dry_run != true` (the tool refuses to verify production bundles — use
  the production verifier for those)

### Schema

```powershell
.\genesis.exe -mode schema
```

Emits an empty skeleton bundle with the current schema version and
default tokenomics params. Useful for downstream tooling that wants to
pin the expected shape in its own tests.
