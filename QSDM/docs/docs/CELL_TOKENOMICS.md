# Cell (CELL) — Tokenomics

> **Status:** Ratified per the Major Update Phase 0 recommendation, awaiting
> counsel review before mainnet genesis. The values in this document are the
> authoritative in-repo numbers used by `pkg/branding` constants,
> `pkg/chain/emission` (Phase 3.3), and the tokenomics dashboard panel. They
> MUST NOT be changed in isolation; any change requires a corresponding
> update to `QSD/docs/docs/REBRAND_NOTES.md` and a new entry in
> `NEXT_STEPS.md`.

This document is the normative reference for the Cell coin's supply,
emission, and fee model. It is **not** a legal offering document, it is not
an investment prospectus, and it is not a commitment until counsel has
signed off. See §8 ("Legal posture") below.

## 1. Coin identity

| Field | Value | Defined in |
|---|---|---|
| Name | `Cell` | `pkg/branding.CoinName` |
| Symbol | `CELL` | `pkg/branding.CoinSymbol` |
| Decimals | `8` | `pkg/branding.CoinDecimals` |
| Smallest unit | `dust` (1 CELL = 10^8 dust) | `pkg/branding.SmallestUnitName` |
| Issued by | QSD mainnet, PoW emission layer | see §3 |
| Non-issuance paths | validator fees (never mint new supply) | see §5 |

The 8-decimal choice intentionally mirrors Bitcoin UX: wallet developers,
block explorers, and exchanges already know how to display 8-decimal coins
correctly, and the smallest-unit name `dust` is short and phonetic for CLI
output (`amount: 12345 dust`).

---

## 2. Supply model

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Total cap | **100,000,000 CELL** (100 M) |
| Founder / insider allocation | **0%** |
| Genesis protocol treasury allocation | **10%** (10,000,000 CELL) |
| Treasury vesting | linear over 48 months, enforced on-chain, locked at genesis |
| Mining emission | **90%** (90,000,000 CELL) over ~20 years |
| Emission curve | halvings every 4 years (see §3) |
| Validator block subsidy | **0** — validators earn only transaction fees |
| Base-fee burn | **undecided** — EIP-1559-style burn is *optional*; decision due before genesis (Phase 0 follow-up item) |

### 2.1 Treasury address

The treasury address is committed in the genesis block. Its balance is
public and its spend policy is enforced by a WASM contract (bound at
genesis) that releases (total_alloc / 48) CELL per month to a
multisig-controlled spend address. The contract address, the multisig
membership, and the spend policy are published in
`QSD/docs/docs/GENESIS.md` (Phase 0 deliverable, pending counsel review).

### 2.2 No founder or insider premine

The project commits to a **fair launch**: no public sale, no private sale,
no ICO, no presale, no founder allocation. All 90 M mining-emission CELL
must be earned by a miner producing a valid PoW proof. This is the cleanest
distribution posture in the current design and is not negotiable without a
public tokenomics revision and governance approval.

The 10 M CELL protocol treasury is minted at genesis. In broad industry usage
that is a premine/genesis allocation, even though it is not assigned to a
founder or insider. QSD uses the precise phrase **genesis protocol treasury
allocation** and publishes its address, lock, vesting, and spending policy.

## 3. Emission schedule

Assumes a target block time of **10 seconds** (matches the current
`pkg/chain` default; see §3.2 for the sensitivity analysis if this changes).
Blocks per 4-year epoch = 12,623,040 (= 4 × 365.25 × 86400 / 10, using the
Julian year so leap years are absorbed uniformly).

The per-block reward is computed as `floor(epoch_allocation_dust /
blocks_per_epoch)` using integer math — these are the EXACT values
returned by `pkg/chain.EmissionSchedule.BlockRewardDust` at each epoch
boundary, not rounded display values. See `pkg/chain/emission.go` and its
unit tests for the canonical definition.

| Epoch | Years | Epoch allocation (CELL) | Block reward (dust) | Block reward (CELL) | Cumulative (CELL, approx) | % of mining cap |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0–4 | 45,000,000 | 356,490,987 | 3.56490987 | 44,999,999.88 | 50.00% |
| 1 | 4–8 | 22,500,000 | 178,245,493 | 1.78245493 | 67,499,999.80 | 75.00% |
| 2 | 8–12 | 11,250,000 | 89,122,746 | 0.89122746 | 78,749,999.74 | 87.50% |
| 3 | 12–16 | 5,625,000 | 44,561,373 | 0.44561373 | 84,374,999.68 | 93.75% |
| 4 | 16–20 | 2,812,500 | 22,280,686 | 0.22280686 | 87,187,499.62 | 96.875% |
| 5 | 20–24 | 1,406,250 | 11,140,343 | 0.11140343 | 88,593,749.56 | 98.4375% |
| 6 | 24–28 | 703,125 | 5,570,171 | 0.05570171 | 89,296,874.50 | 99.2188% |
| 7+ | 28+ | halves every 4y | halves | halves | → 90,000,000 asymptotically | → 100% |

The small (~0.12 CELL per epoch) cumulative shortfall versus the nominal
"50% / 75% / 87.5% / ..." percentages is the integer-division truncation
residue described in §3.1. It is deterministic, unavoidable in exact
integer arithmetic, and bounded — `ConvergenceCheck` verifies the total
shortfall across all epochs stays under 0.00001 % of the 90 M CELL cap.

### 3.1 Invariants enforced by `pkg/chain/emission` (Phase 3.3)

The emission calculator in `pkg/chain/emission.go` is the single source of
truth for runtime. It is pure Go (no CGO), deterministic, and exercised by
the Phase 3.3 unit tests that verify:

1. The sum of per-block rewards over epochs 1..N, extended to N → ∞,
   converges to exactly **9,000,000,000,000,000 dust** (= 90 M CELL).
2. The per-block reward is computed from integer math only (no floating
   point), so two validators on different architectures always agree.
3. The transition block between epochs is well-defined and matches the
   schedule above.
4. If the target block time is re-configured before genesis, the schedule
   re-derives but the total cap stays exactly 90 M CELL.

### 3.2 Sensitivity to block-time changes

If target block time changes, the per-block reward changes but the total
cap does not: the calculator computes per-block reward as
`epoch_allocation_dust / blocks_per_epoch` where `blocks_per_epoch` is
derived from the target block time. Operators changing block time
post-genesis are effectively changing inflation per unit time; the hard-cap
invariant is preserved.

### 3.3 First-halving verification

The first halving is a one-way, non-reversible event. Before mainnet, the
incentivized testnet (Major Update Phase 4, wall-clock bound) MUST run a
compressed-time simulation of the first halving and verify:

- No validator disagreement on the exact halving block.
- No miner accepts a stale reward (old epoch reward) for the first block
  of the new epoch.
- The cumulative-emission invariant holds to the dust across the boundary.

## 4. What Cell is used for

| Use | Notes |
|---|---|
| Transaction fees | Paid to validators. Denominated in dust. |
| WASM contract gas | Gas price in dust/gas; already wired in `pkg/wasm`. |
| Validator bonds | Future: validators stake CELL to participate; slashable. |
| Miner enrollment bonds | 10 CELL, slashable. May be prepaid or accumulated from protocol mining rewards starting from a zero CELL balance. |
| Bridge collateral | Future: denominate bond in CELL via `pkg/bridge`. |
| Governance weight | Future: one CELL = one vote, in proposal-weighted voting. |

Cell is **not** used to pay mining rewards out of a pre-minted pool; mining
rewards are newly minted at block-confirmation time (a `mint` transaction
embedded in the block by the validator who proposes, crediting the winning
miner). After the disclosed genesis treasury allocation, this is the only path
that creates new supply.

---

## 5. Fee model

Validators never dilute holders. All validator revenue comes from transaction
fees on real user transactions. This split is enforced at the protocol
level: a mining-reward transaction with `role = miner` is the **only**
transaction allowed to mint new supply, and a block producer can include at
most one such transaction. A validator that attempts to self-pay via a
mining-reward transaction is producing an invalid block.

### 5.1 Optional EIP-1559-style base-fee burn

The project leans toward adopting an EIP-1559-style split (base fee burned,
priority fee to the validator) because it adds a deflationary pressure
component that offsets emission during epochs 1–4, and because it is the
mechanism users and exchanges already understand. The decision is **open**
and must be made before genesis. It is tracked in `NEXT_STEPS.md` as a
Phase-0 follow-up.

## 6. Comparison to Bitcoin

| Dimension | Bitcoin | Cell |
|---|---|---|
| Total cap | 21,000,000 BTC | 100,000,000 CELL |
| Decimals | 8 | 8 |
| Halving period | every 210,000 blocks (~4 years at 10-min blocks) | every 12,614,400 blocks (~4 years at 10-sec blocks) |
| Block time | ~10 min | 10 sec (target) |
| Initial reward | 50 BTC | 1.4280 CELL |
| Founder / insider allocation | 0 | 0 |
| Treasury | none | 10% vested linearly over 48 months |
| Consensus | pure PoW | PoE + BFT **for consensus**, additive PoW **for emission only** |

The structural difference from Bitcoin is that Cell's PoW layer is
explicitly *additive* — it exists solely to meter coin emission. Consensus
does not depend on PoW. If all miners went offline tomorrow, the validators
would continue producing blocks; the only thing that would stop is new
supply creation.

## 7. Distribution philosophy

**Fair launch, utility-first.** There is no presale, no ICO, no public sale,
no private sale, no airdrop of founder tokens. The treasury allocation is
published on-chain at genesis, time-locked by a WASM contract, and spent
only under the public [Treasury Policy](TREASURY_POLICY.md).

Earning paths at launch are:
- **Mining**: buy a GPU, run `QSD-miner`, earn Cell by producing valid
  proofs.
- **Validating**: operate a VPS validator node, earn transaction fees in
  Cell.
- **Using**: use Cell to pay transaction fees on a service you care about.

### 7.1 Bond from mining earnings

A new NVIDIA miner does not need pre-existing CELL. The miner may submit a
signed `mining_rewards` enrollment with a zero
starting bond. Accepted protocol rewards are then withheld into the on-chain
enrollment record until its 10 CELL target is reached. Only the remainder of
the reward is credited to the spendable wallet balance. This changes reward
destination accounting, not the emission schedule or total reward amount.

The mode is opt-in. Prepaid enrollment remains available, deferred enrollments
are still slashable for invalid proofs, and zero-balance enrollment requires
one-time computational postage to limit persistent-state spam.

The project does not sell Cell. Exchanges that choose to list Cell after
launch operate independently; the QSD project does not negotiate listing
allocations and does not provide market-making inventory.

## 8. Legal posture

This document describes the intended fair-launch utility-token design: zero
founder allocation, a disclosed and vested protocol treasury, mining emission,
and no project token sale. It is a technical and economic specification, not a
legal conclusion. Counsel must review the implemented genesis, custody,
distribution, marketing, and jurisdiction-specific obligations before a
production launch.

This is a posture, not a guarantee. Counsel review is required before
mainnet genesis and before any promotional language is published on
`QSD.tech` or elsewhere. The phrases "investment", "returns", "profit",
and "yield" are forbidden in all project communications (see
`QSD/docs/docs/COPY_FILTERS.md`, Phase 5.4 deliverable).
