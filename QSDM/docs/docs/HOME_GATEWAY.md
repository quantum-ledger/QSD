# QSD Home Gateway

`QSD-home-gateway` lets a home validator publish a narrow public mining/status
surface without exposing the local computer, dashboard, wallet, or admin API.

## Shape

```
miners / validators -> public QSD-relay -> outbound tunnel -> QSD-home-gateway -> 127.0.0.1:8080
```

The home machine only dials outbound to the relay. No router port-forward is
required. The validator can stay bound to `127.0.0.1`.

## Default Public Allowlist

Allowed by default:

- `GET /api/v1/status`
- `GET /api/v1/health/live`
- `GET /api/v1/health/ready`
- `GET /api/v1/mining/work`
- `GET /api/v1/mining/challenge`
- `POST /api/v1/mining/submit`
- `GET /api/v1/mining/enrollment/<node_id>`
- `GET /api/v1/mining/emission`
- `GET /api/v1/mining/blocks`

Blocked by default:

- dashboard root and dashboard APIs
- `/api/admin/*`
- `/api/v1/wallet/*`
- contracts, bridge, governance mutation routes
- enrollment mutation routes unless `--allow-enrollment` is passed

## Home Side

Build:

```powershell
cd QSD\source
go build -o .cache\local-validator\QSD-home-gateway.exe .\cmd\QSD-home-gateway
```

Generate a slot key:

```powershell
.\.cache\local-validator\QSD-home-gateway.exe --generate-key
```

Run after the relay slot is configured:

```powershell
.\scripts\start_home_gateway.ps1 -Relay https://relay.example -Slot your-slot-id
```

## Disk Resilience

Validators reserve 2 GiB of free space for ledger persistence by default. Block
sealing and peer block admission pause before that reserve is crossed, then
resume automatically after space is restored. Override the threshold only when
the state volume has been sized deliberately:

```text
QSD_MIN_PERSISTENCE_FREE_BYTES=2147483648
```

The value must be an unsigned byte count of at least 256 MiB. A persistence
write error still fails closed until restart; startup can repair only one fully
appended journal block when the saved state root proves that the block was not
committed.

On Windows home-validator installations, `watch_local_stack.ps1` runs
`maintain_generated_cache.ps1` every 30 minutes. It retains the newest builds
and may remove only old entries directly under `.cache/release` and
`.cache/releases`. It never removes validator state, recovery archives,
wallets, signing material, or `.cache/private`.

## Relay Side

Add a slot to the relay allowlist:

```toml
[[slot]]
slot_id = "your-slot-id"
key_hex = "<the 64 hex chars generated on the home machine>"
note = "home validator gateway"
```

Then run `QSD-relay` as described in `TUNNEL_QUICKSTART.md`.

## Security Rules

- Do not expose `8080`, `8081`, or `4001` directly from a home router.
- Keep the relay slot key private; rotate it if it is pasted into chat or logs.
- Keep the relay as a dumb forwarder. Consensus authority remains in the
  validator and mining proof verification remains on the validator.
