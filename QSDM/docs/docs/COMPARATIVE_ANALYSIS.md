# Comparative Analysis: QSD vs. Blockchain vs. DAG

## Overview

This document provides a comparative analysis of Quantum-Secure Dynamic Mesh Ledger (QSD), traditional Blockchain, and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based distributed ledger technologies. The goal is to highlight the key differences, advantages, and limitations of each approach.

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Data Structure        | Dynamic 2D/3D Mesh                    | Linear chain of blocks               | Directed Acyclic Graph               |
| Consensus Mechanism   | Proof-of-Entanglement (PoE)            | Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), others | Various DAG-specific consensus (e.g., Tangle, Hashgraph) |
| Transaction Validation| Multi-parent cell validation           | Block validation                    | Transaction validation via DAG traversal |
| Scalability          | Designed for manual submesh routing and 3D mesh validation | Limited by block size and time      | High throughput via parallel validation |

## 2. Security

| Feature               | QSD                                   | Blockchain                            | DAG                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Quantum Resistance    | Uses ML-DSA-87 (256-bit, NIST FIPS 204) | Typically vulnerable to quantum attacks | Varies; most use classical cryptography |
| Attack Detection      | Rule-based isolation and quarantine   | Deep learning or heuristic-based    | Depends on DAG implementation       |
| Governance            | Manual snapshot-based voting           | On-chain governance or off-chain    | Varies; often decentralized voting  |

## 3. Performance & Resource Use

| Feature               | QSD                                   | Blockchain                            | DAG                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Hardware Optimization | Utilizes GPU (GTX 3050) for parallel hashing and CUDA validation | CPU/GPU intensive (PoW) or moderate (PoS) | Generally lightweight, optimized for parallelism |
| Storage               | SQLite with Zstandard compression      | Large blockchain databases          | Lightweight, often DAG pruning      |
| Throughput            | Manual routing for high-fee transactions | Limited by block time and size      | High throughput via parallel processing |

## 4. Development & Extensibility

| Feature               | QSD                                   | Blockchain                            | DAG                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Modularity            | Highly modular with manual submesh templates | Modular but often monolithic        | Modular, supports various DAG models |
| AI/ML Dependencies    | None (manual rules and governance)     | Varies; some use AI for analytics   | Varies                             |
| WASM Integration      | WASM SDK for wallet and validator integration | Limited or experimental             | Some DAGs support WASM or smart contracts |
