# MINING_PROTOCOL_V2_NVIDIA_LOCKED.md — Superseded

> **Status:** SUPERSEDED. This file was the original Phase-1
> design draft for the v2 mining protocol. The normative spec
> now lives at
> [`MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md`](./MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md).
>
> This stub is retained so old links (PRs, issues, the landing
> page, code comments referencing
> `MINING_PROTOCOL_V2_NVIDIA_LOCKED.md`) keep resolving. New
> links should target `MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md` directly.
>
> **Where did the content go?** Section-by-section mapping below.
> The verbatim original is preserved in git history at commit
> `6826bc4` of this path.

## What about the on-chain enrollment / slashing surface?

That body of work was added during Phase 2c+ and is documented
in the canonical doc at
[`MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md §8`](./MINING_PROTOCOL_V2.md#8-on-chain-enrollment--slashing).
It is not present in this superseded original.
