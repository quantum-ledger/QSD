## 0. Executive summary

QSD v2 is the production mining protocol. It locks mining to
NVIDIA GPUs along two axes — **cryptographic** (mandatory
attestation) and **economic** (Tensor-Core-biased PoW, deferred)
— and adds an on-chain enrollment / slashing layer that makes the
NVIDIA lock observable and enforceable without trusting any
single validator.

1. **Hard fork from v1.** Blocks before `FORK_V2_HEIGHT` follow
   `MINING_PROTOCOL.md`. Blocks at or after `FORK_V2_HEIGHT`
   follow this document. Because v2 launches via a chain reset
   (§10.3), `FORK_V2_HEIGHT = 0`.
2. **Mandatory attestation.** `Proof.Attestation` is now a
   consensus-checked field. A proof with an empty, unparseable,
   non-whitelisted, stale, or cryptographically-invalid
   attestation is rejected at the verifier. v1's "transparency
   signal, not a consensus rule" stance is gone.
3. **Tiered trust anchor.**
   - `nvidia-cc-v1` — datacenter Hopper / Blackwell GPUs,
     verified via NVIDIA-signed AIK quote against a
     genesis-pinned root. Implementation
     [shipped](#5-trust-anchors) in `pkg/mining/attest/cc/`.
   - `nvidia-hmac-v1` — consumer NVIDIA GPUs (Turing / Ampere /
     Ada / Blackwell consumer), verified via HMAC over a
     canonical-JSON bundle, bound to a stake-locked operator
     entry in the on-chain registry. Implementation shipped in
     `pkg/mining/attest/hmac/`.
4. **Tensor-Core PoW mixin.** Specified in §4. **Not yet
   implemented** — gated behind a future `FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT`
   that activates as a soft-tightening fork once
   `cmd/QSD-miner-cuda` lands. Pre-mixin, v2 proofs validate
   under the legacy double-SHA256 PoW, so attestation is the
   only NVIDIA-locking surface that is consensus-active today.
5. **On-chain enrollment.** Operators register
   `(node_id, gpu_uuid, hmac_key)` tuples by submitting a
   `QSD/enroll/v1` transaction that locks `MIN_ENROLL_STAKE = 10
   CELL`. Unenroll bonds the stake for `UnbondWindow`
   (default 30 d) and the `gpu_uuid` releases at maturity, so a
   physical card can be re-enrolled by a fresh `node_id` after
   the original record retires. Implementation in
   `pkg/mining/enrollment/`.
6. **On-chain slashing.** A `QSD/slash/v1` transaction can
   drain bonded stake by submitting verifier-checked evidence.
   All three evidence kinds now ship with concrete verifiers:
   `forged-attestation`, `double-mining`, and `freshness-cheat`
   (the last gated on a `BlockInclusionWitness`; the production
   default `RejectAllWitness` rejects all such slashes pending
   BFT finality — see §12.3). Implementation in
   `pkg/mining/slashing/` and the chain-side applier in
   `pkg/chain/slash_apply.go`.
7. **Miner UX.** `cmd/QSDminer-console` ships an opt-in v2 path
   (`--protocol=v2`) that drives the full enrollment → challenge
   → HMAC-bundle → submit loop, with a built-in setup wizard, a
   live `v2 NVIDIA` panel row, and a background enrollment
   poller. The CPU-only PoW kernel is preserved purely for
   testnet attestation participation; once
   `FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT` activates, this binary is no longer
   profitable. The CUDA-native miner (`cmd/QSD-miner-cuda`) is
   the deferred replacement (§12.2).

The rest of this document is the normative wire spec
(§§1–4), the implementation contract (§§5–9), activation
mechanics (§10), the attacker model (§11), and the deferred-work
+ decision register (§§12–13).

## 1. What changes relative to v1

All references below are to v1 spec
[`MINING_PROTOCOL.md`](./MINING_PROTOCOL.md) and to Go source
paths under `QSD/source/`.

| Area | v1 (current) | v2 (this spec) |
|---|---|---|
| Goal §1.1(2) | "GPU-favored, NVIDIA-favored, NVIDIA-not-required. Portable OpenCL / Vulkan / CPU fallbacks MUST remain compilable and correct — they only lose economically." | **"NVIDIA-required."** Non-NVIDIA implementations of `ComputeMixDigest` remain compilable for protocol auditing, but proofs produced by them are unconditionally rejected at the attestation gate. |
| `Proof.Attestation` field | Optional. An absent, stale, or unverifiable attestation MUST NOT cause rejection (`§6`). | **Mandatory.** Empty / unparseable / unknown-type / signature-invalid / stale → consensus reject. |
| `Proof.Version` | `1` | `2` (`mining.ProtocolVersionV2`). |
| `Attestation.Type` whitelist | `"ngc-v1"` (informational only). | `"nvidia-cc-v1"` (datacenter CC) and `"nvidia-hmac-v1"` (consumer GPUs). Whitelist enforced at the verifier dispatcher. |
| Trust anchor | None — `Verifier.Verify` never reads `Attestation`. | Genesis-pinned NVIDIA CC root material + on-chain operator registry (HMAC path). See §5. |
| PoW hash | SHA3-256 in a 64-step DAG walk (`pkg/mining/pow.go::ComputeMixDigest`). | SHA3-256 + Tensor-Core FP16 matmul mixin per DAG step (§4). **Deferred** — gated behind `FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT`. |
| Validator SLO | Verify any single proof in < 100 ms single-core, batch 1000 in < 2 s (`§1.1(4)`). | Unchanged. The Tensor-Core mixin runs only on the miner side; the validator re-hashes via a deterministic CPU reference. |
| Attestation endpoint `/api/v1/monitoring/ngc-proof` | Monitoring-only sink, never feeds consensus. | Unchanged role. v2 attestations travel inline on the proof. The legacy ingest endpoint remains for dashboards; it is no longer the consensus path. |

---

## 2. What does NOT change

1. Validators remain CPU-only. The NVIDIA lock is on the *miner*
   side of the miner/validator split (see
   [`NODE_ROLES.md`](./NODE_ROLES.md)). A validator never verifies
   an NGC signature against a GPU it owns; it verifies against
   genesis-pinned NVIDIA roots and the on-chain operator registry.
2. Cell tokenomics ([`CELL_TOKENOMICS.md`](./CELL_TOKENOMICS.md))
   are unchanged. The fork resets supply to zero at height 0
   because the testnet has no real users (2026-04-24 owner
   sign-off, §13.4); the issuance curve from that point is
   identical to v1.
3. PoE+BFT consensus among validators (`pkg/chain`,
   `pkg/consensus`) is unchanged. v2 touches mining only.
4. Proof-ID derivation (`pkg/mining/proof.go::ID`) still excludes
   `Attestation` from the hash input. Two validly-signed proofs
   with identical `(epoch, height, nonce, batch_root)` and
   different attestation bundles share a proof-id; the verifier
   rejects the second one for duplicate-proof reasons, not for
   attestation reasons.
5. The `apps/QSD-nvidia-ngc/` sidecar keeps operating and keeps
   pushing to `/api/v1/monitoring/ngc-proof`. That path is
   dashboards and transparency surface; it does not feed
   consensus.

---

## 3. Wire format

### 3.1 `Attestation` struct (v2)

```go
// pkg/mining/proof.go (v2). Field order is normative per
// MINING_PROTOCOL.md §4.1 canonical-JSON rules. Do NOT reorder.
type Attestation struct {
    Type                 string   `json:"type"`
    BundleBase64         string   `json:"bundle"`
    GPUArch              string   `json:"gpu_arch"`
    ClaimedHashrateHPS   uint64   `json:"claimed_hashrate_hps"`

    // Pinned outside Bundle so the verifier can deserialize
    // enough metadata to dispatch to the right verify path
    // without parsing a variable-schema nested document.
    Nonce                [32]byte `json:"nonce"`     // server-issued freshness challenge, lowercase hex
    IssuedAt             int64    `json:"issued_at"` // unix seconds; tolerance is FRESHNESS_WINDOW
}
```

Canonical JSON wire order, nested in `Proof`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "epoch":   "<uint64 as string>",
  "height":  "<uint64 as string>",
  "header_hash": "<hex 32B>",
  "miner_addr":  "QSD1...",
  "batch_root":  "<hex 32B>",
  "batch_count": <uint32>,
  "nonce":       "<hex 16B>",
  "mix_digest":  "<hex 32B>",
  "attestation": {
    "type": "nvidia-cc-v1" | "nvidia-hmac-v1",
    "bundle": "<base64 blob; contents depend on type>",
    "gpu_arch": "hopper" | "ada-lovelace" | "blackwell" | ...,
    "claimed_hashrate_hps": "<uint64 as string>",
    "nonce":     "<hex 32B>",
    "issued_at": "<int64 as string>"
  }
}
```

Zero-value `Attestation{}` → `validateShape` → reject with
`ErrAttestationRequired`. This is the hard invariant the verifier
enforces above every other check.

### 3.2 `Attestation.Bundle` payload — `nvidia-cc-v1`

Used by Hopper / Blackwell datacenter GPUs running NVIDIA
Confidential Computing. The bundle is a base64-encoded
length-prefixed binary blob carrying:

1. **NVIDIA device certificate chain** — the per-GPU attestation
   certificate chain, rooted in a genesis-pinned NVIDIA issuing
   CA public key (§5.1).
2. **Quote** — an ECDSA signature from the GPU AIK
   (Attestation Identity Key) over the canonical preimage:
   ```
   H( device_uuid
   || challenge_nonce
   || issued_at
   || miner_addr
   || batch_root
   || mix_digest
   || challenge_signer_id
   || challenge_sig )
   ```
   `challenge_nonce == Attestation.Nonce`; the other fields
   come from the enclosing `Proof`. `challenge_signer_id` /
   `challenge_sig` mirror the consumer-GPU path (§3.3) — they
   bind the bundle to a specific validator-issued challenge so
   replay outside the freshness window is detectable in the
   AIK preimage itself.
3. **PCR-equivalent measurements** — current GPU firmware
   version + driver version, recorded by the CC subsystem so a
   downgrade-to-vulnerable-firmware attack is detectable.

#### Verifier flow (9 steps, all enforced)

```
1. Parse the cert chain; verify it terminates in a
   genesis-pinned NVIDIA CA public key.
2. Verify the AIK Quote signature over the canonical preimage
   above using the leaf cert's public key.
3. Check challenge_nonce == Attestation.Nonce.
4. Check Attestation.IssuedAt is within FRESHNESS_WINDOW of the
   validator's wall clock and not future-dated past
   AllowedFutureSkew.
5. Verify (challenge_signer_id, challenge_sig) against the
   registered ChallengeVerifier — same crypto the HMAC path
   uses. (Skipped only if the operator deliberately wires
   ChallengeVerifier=nil; production MUST set it.)
6. Check PCR firmware/driver versions against the genesis-
   pinned minimum floor for the claimed gpu_arch.
7. Look up (device_uuid, challenge_nonce) in the replay cache;
   reject if seen.
8. Leaf cert `Subject.CommonName` ↔ `gpu_arch` consistency
   per §4.6.5 — evidence-based, see that section for the
   accept/reject table and the longest-pattern tie-breaker
   rule. (Implemented as Step 9 in `cc/verifier.go`; this
   spec lists it as #8 because the freshness + replay
   sub-steps above are grouped.)
9. If all pass → proof is attested. Else → reject with the
   precise reason.
```

Reference implementation:
[`pkg/mining/attest/cc/verifier.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/cc/verifier.go),
bundle parser
[`pkg/mining/attest/cc/bundle.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/cc/bundle.go).
Production wiring: `attest.ProductionConfig.CCConfig`. When no
NVIDIA root is pinned, the dispatcher falls through to
[`cc.NewStubVerifier()`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/cc/stub.go)
which always rejects — fail-closed.

Test coverage: 28 unit tests including 13 negative cases
(tampered AIK signature, wrong root, expired leaf, nonce
mismatch, issued_at mismatch, miner_addr/mix_digest preimage
tamper, stale, future-dated, below firmware floor, below driver
floor, replay through `NonceStore`, malformed base64, unknown
JSON field, over-length cert chain). Test vectors are generated
**deterministically in-process** by
[`pkg/mining/attest/cc/testvectors.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/cc/testvectors.go);
no testdata files. The seam to swap in real `nvtrust` framing is
a single `ParseBundle` reimplementation — verifier code does not
change.

### 3.3 `Attestation.Bundle` payload — `nvidia-hmac-v1`

Used by consumer NVIDIA GPUs (Turing / Ampere / Ada / Blackwell
consumer). The bundle is a base64-encoded canonical-JSON object:

```json
{
  "node_id":              "<operator-registered handle, e.g. 'alice-rtx4090-01'>",
  "gpu_uuid":             "<GPU instance UUID from nvidia-smi, hex>",
  "gpu_name":             "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090",
  "driver_ver":           "572.16",
  "cuda_version":         "12.8",
  "compute_cap":          "8.9",
  "nonce":                "<same 32-byte hex as Attestation.Nonce>",
  "issued_at":            <unix seconds>,
  "challenge_bind":       "<hex H(miner_addr || batch_root || mix_digest)>",
  "challenge_sig":        "<hex validator signature over (signer_id, issued_at, nonce)>",
  "challenge_signer_id":  "<validator identity that issued this challenge>",
  "hmac":                 "<hex HMAC-SHA256(operator_key, canonical_json_without_hmac_field)>"
}
```

The shown order is human-reading order. **Canonical-form field
order is alphabetical on the JSON key** — `challenge_sig` and
`challenge_signer_id` land between `challenge_bind` and
`compute_cap`. Reference implementation:
[`pkg/mining/attest/hmac/bundle.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/hmac/bundle.go)
+ [`pkg/mining/challenge/`](../../source/pkg/mining/challenge/).

#### Verifier flow (9 steps)

```
1. Parse JSON.
2. Recompute H(miner_addr || batch_root || mix_digest) from the
   enclosing Proof; assert it matches bundle.challenge_bind.
3. Look up bundle.node_id in the on-chain operator registry
   (§5.2). If absent or revoked → reject.
4. Fetch the HMAC key associated with that node_id from the
   registry. Recompute HMAC-SHA256 over canonical-JSON minus
   the hmac field. Reject on mismatch.
5. Fetch the GPU UUID from the registry. Assert
   bundle.gpu_uuid matches. Reject on mismatch.
6a. Assert bundle.nonce == Attestation.Nonce and
    bundle.issued_at == Attestation.IssuedAt.
6b. Reconstruct challenge.Challenge{Nonce, IssuedAt, SignerID,
    Signature} from bundle.{nonce, issued_at,
    challenge_signer_id, challenge_sig}; verify the signature
    using the SignerID's registered public key. Reject unknown
    signer_id or bad signature.
6c. Assert bundle.issued_at falls within FRESHNESS_WINDOW of
    the validator's wall clock and ≤ AllowedFutureSkew ahead.
6d. Check the nonce-replay cache; reject if (node_id, nonce)
    already seen.
7. Assert bundle.gpu_name does NOT contain any deny-list
   substring (§5.3 — empty at genesis).
8. Verify the proof's `gpu_arch` is on the closed-enum
   allowlist AND the bundle's `gpu_name` is consistent with it
   (`pkg/mining/attest/archcheck`). The arch enum check fires
   in the outer verifier before this dispatcher; the
   gpu_arch ↔ gpu_name cross-check fires here. See §4.6 for
   the full rationale + table.
9. If all pass → proof is attested. Else → reject.

### 4.1 Why a PoW mixin at all

The attestation gate (§3) is the consensus rule. A rogue
validator that ignores it could accept proofs from anybody.
Economic lock: make the proof itself uneconomic to produce
without a Tensor Core, so a fork that bypasses the attestation
rule also gets no hashrate advantage from CPU miners.

### 4.2 The mixin

v1 hash (`pkg/mining/pow.go::ComputeMixDigest`):

```
seed := SHA3-256(header_hash || nonce)
mix  := seed
for s in 0..64:
    idx := uint32(BE(mix[0..4])) mod N
    mix := SHA3-256(mix || D_e[idx])
return mix
```

v2 hash (reference: `pkg/mining/pow/v2/`):

```
seed := SHA3-256(header_hash || nonce)
mix  := seed
for s in 0..64:
    idx   := uint32(BE(mix[0..4])) mod N
    entry := D_e[idx]
    M     := MatrixFromMix(mix)        // 16x16 FP16, see §4.2.1
    v     := VectorFromEntry(entry)    // 16 FP16 elements, see §4.2.2
    r     := TensorMul(M, v)           // 16 FP16 elements, see §4.2.3
    tc    := PackFP16VectorBE(r)       // 32 bytes
    mix   := SHA3-256(mix || entry || tc)
return mix
```

The matmul output is deterministic IEEE-754 FP16 with a pinned
rounding mode (`round-to-nearest-even`), so the validator's CPU
reference produces bit-identical `tc` to a compliant miner. The
following four byte-exact decisions (locked, hard-fork-only to
change) make the spec testable across CPU, CUDA, and any future
accelerator:

#### 4.2.1 Matrix expansion (mix → 16×16 FP16)

```
M_bytes := SHAKE256("QSD/pow/v2/matrix\x00" || mix), read 512 bytes
for i,j in 0..16:
    M[i][j] := DecodeFP16BE(M_bytes[ 2*(16*i + j) : 2*(16*i + j) + 2 ])
```

The 32-byte mix is too small to fill a 16×16 FP16 matrix
(4096 bits) directly; SHAKE256 is the FIPS-202 XOF used to fan
it out. The domain-separator byte string keeps this expansion
disjoint from every other SHA3 use in the protocol.

#### 4.2.2 Vector unpack (entry → 16 FP16)

```
for k in 0..16:
    v[k] := DecodeFP16BE(D_e[idx][ 2k : 2k+2 ])
```

The 32-byte DAG entry is exactly 16 FP16 elements wide, so no
expansion is needed.

#### 4.2.3 Matmul (per output element r[i])

```
acc := float32(0)                                      // +0, IEEE-754 FP32
for j in 0..16:
    acc = acc + (float32(M[i][j]) * float32(v[j]))     // RNE, left-to-right
r[i] := Float32ToFP16RNE(acc)                          // RNE down-convert
```

* FP16×FP16 multiplication is performed by widening both
  operands to FP32 (exact, since 22-bit products fit in FP32's
  24-bit mantissa) and using the platform's IEEE-754 FP32
  multiply.
* Accumulation is **strict left-to-right in FP32**, NOT
  tree-reduction. This is the most common point of divergence
  from naive CUDA WMMA implementations; miners using the WMMA
  fast-path must emulate this loop's reduction order in software
  (one mac per thread) to stay bit-compatible. The validator is
  authoritative.
* Final FP16 down-convert uses round-to-nearest, ties-to-even,
  with the canonical NaN payload of §4.2.4.

#### 4.2.4 NaN canonicalization

IEEE-754 leaves the NaN payload (1022 distinct FP16 patterns,
millions of FP32 patterns) implementation-defined; CUDA, x86,
and ARM each emit different ones, so we cannot allow them
through to SHA3-256. Therefore, at every encode boundary
(`DecodeFP16BE`, `EncodeFP16BE`, `Float32ToFP16RNE`):

* Any FP16 NaN is rewritten to `FP16Qnan = 0x7E00` (sign 0,
  exp all-ones, mantissa `1100000000`).
* Any FP32 NaN is rewritten to `FP32Qnan = 0x7FC00000`.

Subnormals and signed zero are **preserved**, no flush-to-zero,
no -0 collapse — these are determinable bit patterns and matter
when the matmul output happens to land near 2^-14.

### 4.3 Validator cost

Single-proof CPU verify budget on a Sandy Bridge-era Xeon E5-2670
(2.6 GHz, 2012-vintage), measured by
`pkg/mining/pow/v2/bench_test.go`:

| Stage                      | Per-step | × 64 | Share |
|----------------------------|----------|------|-------|
| `MatrixFromMix` (SHAKE256) | 3.17 µs  | 203 µs | 68 %  |
| `TensorMul`                | 0.53 µs  | 34 µs  | 11 %  |
| `SHA3-256` step body + DAG | ~0.95 µs | 61 µs  | 21 %  |
| **Total `ComputeMixDigestV2`** | — | **~298 µs** | 100 % |

That's well inside the original §1.1(4) `< 100 ms` SLO and inside
this protocol's tighter ~700 µs informal budget by a factor of two
on a 13-year-old CPU. Newer hardware (post-Skylake) cuts the total
roughly in half again.

The reference implementation is pure Go, no CGO, no assembly, no
build tags. The two non-trivial micro-optimizations are:

* **`fp16ToFP32LUT`** — a 256 KB read-only table populated at
  package init from the unrolled IEEE-754 reference
  (`fp16ToFloat32Slow`). `FP16ToFloat32(x)` is then a single
  indexed load, ~2 ns vs ~7 ns for the branch-tree version.
  An init-time self-check panics if the table disagrees with the
  reference on a hand-picked set of boundary inputs; an
  exhaustive 65,536-entry equivalence test
  (`TestFP16ToFP32_LUTMatchesSlow`) is the regression bar in CI.
* Stack-friendly per-step SHAKE256 allocation. Earlier attempts
  to "reuse" the SHAKE state across the 64 outer-loop iterations
  via a struct caused the underlying Keccak state to escape to
  the heap (132 allocs/op) and net out slower; the current
  per-call form keeps allocations to a single 32-byte digest
  copy on the entire 64-step walk.

A future SIMD/BLAS-backed fast-path (e.g. AVX-512 F16C, Apple
NEON `vcvt_f32_f16`, or a CGO-bridged `gonum/blas` for batch
verification) MUST be byte-exact-equivalent to the reference;
the frozen golden vector in
`pkg/mining/pow/v2/mixdigest_test.go` is the conformance bar.

### 4.4 Miner cost

On an RTX 4090 Tensor Core: 16×16 FP16 matmul per dispatched
thread completes in ~20 ns, ~250x faster than CPU. H100 with
FP16 Tensor Cores: ~8 ns. Expected hashrate: ~5 MH/s on RTX
4090, ~20-40 MH/s on H100. CPU miner: ~0.02 MH/s. That is the
economic lock.

### 4.5 Backward compatibility

The v1 function `pkg/mining.ComputeMixDigest` stays in-tree
unchanged for replaying pre-fork blocks (audit), protocol-
conformance tests, and any future soft-unlock if governance ever
wants to re-enable non-NVIDIA mining. Selection between v1 and
v2 is height-gated on `FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT`; nothing about the
proof wire format changes (the existing `Proof.Version=2` field
already covers it — pre-fork v2 proofs simply happen to use the
v1 walk for `mix_digest`).

### 4.6 Arch-spoof rejection (§3.3 step 8)

> **Correction (2026-04-29):** an earlier draft of this section
> proposed using a "matmul rounding fingerprint" to detect
> arch-spoof — i.e. inferring the actual GPU architecture from

Step 8 ("`mix_digest` consistent with claimed `gpu_arch`") is
implemented today as **two cross-checks against the parts of
the attestation surface a casual spoofer cannot freely swap**:

#### 4.6.1 Closed-enum allowlist for `Attestation.GPUArch`

`Attestation.GPUArch` MUST canonicalise to one of:

| Canonical | Aliases | Compute capability | Family |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hopper` | — | SM 9.0 | Datacenter (H100, H200, H800) |
| `blackwell` | — | SM 10.0 | Datacenter + consumer (B100, B200, GB200, RTX 50) |
| `ada-lovelace` | `ada` | SM 8.9 | Consumer + workstation (RTX 40, L40, L40S, RTX 6000 Ada) |
| `ampere` | — | SM 8.0 / 8.6 | Datacenter + consumer (A100, A40, A30, RTX 30, RTX A) |
| `turing` | — | SM 7.5 | Consumer + workstation (RTX 20, GTX 16, T4, RTX 6000) |

Older arches (Volta, Pascal, Maxwell, Kepler) are intentionally
**off** the allowlist — their compute-capability and driver
floors no longer satisfy the per-arch §5.1 minima reliably.
The `ada` short form is accepted as an alias for backward
compatibility with the QSDminer-console output that predates
the `ada-lovelace` long form; a future fork may tighten this.

The allowlist is the closed enum in
[`pkg/mining/attest/archcheck/archcheck.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/archcheck/archcheck.go).
Adding a new arch is consensus-affecting and lands as a single
registry append plus the matching `gpu_name` patterns in the
same package — an `init()` self-check panics at boot if the
two halves disagree.

This check fires in the OUTER verifier
([`pkg/mining/verifier.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/verifier.go))
**before** dispatching to the per-type cryptographic verifier,
so a malformed / typo / future-arch-sneak proof costs a single
map lookup and never pays the HMAC or X.509 work.

#### 4.6.2 `gpu_arch` ↔ `bundle.gpu_name` consistency (HMAC path)

For the HMAC path, the bundle's `gpu_name` field is HMAC-bound
under the operator's enrollment-time secret (covered by
`Bundle.CanonicalForMAC`). An attacker who has already forged
a valid HMAC cannot **also** flip `gpu_name` post-hoc — they
had to choose at sign time. So we cross-check the canonical
arch against a substring-pattern table of real shipping NVIDIA
product names:

| Canonical arch | Accepted `gpu_name` substrings |
|---|---|
| `hopper` | `h100`, `h200`, `h800` |
| `blackwell` | `b100`, `b200`, `gb200`, `rtx 50` |
| `ada-lovelace` | `rtx 40`, `l4`, `l40`, `rtx 6000 ada`, `rtx 5000 ada`, `rtx 4500 ada`, `rtx 4000 ada`, `rtx 2000 ada` |
| `ampere` | `a100`, `a40`, `a30`, `a16`, `a10`, `a2`, `rtx 30`, `rtx a` |
| `turing` | `rtx 20`, `gtx 16`, `t4`, `quadro rtx`, `rtx 8000`, `rtx 6000` |

Patterns are matched case-insensitively after whitespace
collapse. A bundle whose `gpu_name` does not contain any of
the patterns for its claimed arch is rejected with
`ErrArchGPUNameMismatch` (wrapped in
`mining.ErrAttestationSignatureInvalid` so the `attestation`
reason metric still groups it).

This catches the **lazy spoof** — an attacker who flips
`gpu_arch=hopper` but forgot to also lie about the
`nvidia-smi` name on their consumer Ada card. The
**determined spoof** (operator colluding with a non-NVIDIA or
wrong-arch card and lying about both fields) is still trapped
by the on-chain registry's `(gpu_uuid, hmac_key)` pairing
(§5.2) and economically by §5.4 stake bonding plus §8 slashing
risk (`forged-attestation`, `freshness-cheat`).

This check fires in the HMAC verifier
([`pkg/mining/attest/hmac/verifier.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/hmac/verifier.go))
as the long-deferred step 8 of the §3.3 acceptance flow,
**after** the HMAC field check (step 4) and the deny-list
check (step 7) — so a determined spoofer has to clear every
upstream gate before being trapped here.

#### 4.6.3 Hashrate-band plausibility

`Attestation.ClaimedHashrateHPS` is operator-supplied and
ungated by any cryptographic check — the miner can put any
number they want there. It feeds the leaderboard / pool
telemetry surface, not consensus, so the worst case is
reputational manipulation rather than block-acceptance
manipulation. Even so, an obviously-implausible value is a
strong signal that the rest of the attestation is suspect:

| Canonical arch | Min H/s | Max H/s | Reference cards |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `turing` | 10 000 | 5 000 000 | T4 ~0.5 MH/s, GTX 16 lower |
| `ampere` | 50 000 | 50 000 000 | RTX 30 ~1-2 MH/s, A100 ~5-10 MH/s |
| `ada-lovelace` | 100 000 | 50 000 000 | RTX 40 ~3-5 MH/s, L40S ~6-8 MH/s |
| `hopper` | 1 000 000 | 200 000 000 | H100 ~20-40 MH/s, H200 higher |
| `blackwell` | 5 000 000 | 500 000 000 | B200 ~40-80 MH/s, GB200 NVL72 higher |

Bounds are inclusive on both ends and intentionally **wide**
(≈100x range per arch) so legitimate variation across a
product family doesn't trip false positives. The check
rejects only the obvious lies; subtler manipulation is left
to off-chain analysis.

`ClaimedHashrateHPS == 0` is treated as **"not asserted"**
and passes through. This preserves backward compat with miners
and test fixtures that don't populate the field. Tightening
to require a non-zero value is a future fork concern.

This check fires in the OUTER verifier (same site as §4.6.1
allowlist), AFTER `ValidateOuterArch` succeeds and BEFORE
dispatching to the per-type cryptographic verifier — so an
implausible-hashrate proof never pays the HMAC or X.509
work. Source:
[`pkg/mining/attest/archcheck/archcheck.go::ValidateClaimedHashrate`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/archcheck/archcheck.go).

#### 4.6.4 Operator metrics

Two Prometheus counter families surface the §4.6 rejection
rate to dashboards and alerting:

```
QSD_attest_archspoof_rejected_total{reason="unknown_arch" | "gpu_name_mismatch" | "cc_subject_mismatch"}
QSD_attest_hashrate_rejected_total{arch="hopper" | "blackwell" | "ada-lovelace" | "ampere" | "turing" | "unknown"}
```

Cardinality stays bounded (≤ 9 series total). Both counters
are wired through the dependency-inverted
`mining.SetMiningMetricsRecorder` registration pattern (see
`pkg/mining/metrics.go` and `pkg/monitoring/mining_recorder.go`).

#### 4.6.5 CC-path leaf cert subject ↔ arch consistency

The CC path (`nvidia-cc-v1`) already binds the device
certificate chain to a specific physical GPU at the
cryptographic level (§3.2 step 1 cert-chain pin + §3.2 step 4
AIK signature). On top of that, the verifier runs a Step 9
**evidence-based** consistency check between
`Attestation.GPUArch` and the leaf cert's
`Subject.CommonName`:

| Leaf CN content | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Contains a substring matching THIS arch's pattern table (e.g. `"NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3"` with `gpu_arch=hopper`) | **accept** — positive evidence agrees with claim |
| Contains a substring matching ANOTHER arch's pattern table (e.g. `"NVIDIA H100"` with `gpu_arch=ada-lovelace`) | **reject** with `archcheck.ErrArchCertSubjectMismatch` wrapped under `mining.ErrAttestationSignatureInvalid` |
| Contains NO substring from any arch's pattern table (test fixtures, corporate AIK label like `"NVIDIA Confidential Computing AIK"`, OID-based model encoding) | **accept** — no evidence to evaluate; cert-chain pin + AIK signature are the locks |
| `Attestation.GPUArch` is empty (standalone-call path, pre-fork bring-up vectors) | **accept** — Step 9 skipped |

**Why "evidence-based, not strict".** Production NVIDIA CC
chains have not yet been audited end-to-end for where they
encode the GPU model — it could be the Subject CN, an OU
field, a custom OID extension, or nowhere on the leaf at all
(model only inferable from the issuing intermediate). A
strict "must contain a known product string" rule would
false-reject honest validators whose cert format hasn't
landed in the codebase yet. The evidence-based rule rejects
only positive contradictions and falls back on the
cryptographic locks otherwise.

**Pattern overlap resolution.** When the subject matches
multiple arch patterns (e.g. `"RTX 6000 Ada Generation"`
matches both `"rtx 6000 ada"` (Ada) and `"rtx 6000"`
(Turing) as substrings), the **longest-pattern match wins**.
The Ada attribution dominates and a `gpu_arch=turing` claim
on that subject is rejected.

**Source.**
[`archcheck.ValidateBundleArchConsistencyCC`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/archcheck/archcheck.go)
implements the rule;
[`pkg/mining/attest/cc/verifier.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/cc/verifier.go)
wires it as Step 9, after Step 8 (PCR floor). Rejection
metric:
`QSD_attest_archspoof_rejected_total{reason="cc_subject_mismatch"}`.

#### 4.6.6 Activation height

This whole section is gated by `FORK_V2_HEIGHT` (the v2
attestation flow), **not** `FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT`. The
arch-spoof checks are part of the attestation surface, so
they must be active wherever the attestation surface is
active — which is from v2 launch onwards. The TC-mixin fork
height is independent (it controls only the §10 PoW algorithm
selection).

---

## 5. Trust anchors

This section records what is **shipped today**, not what the
draft recommended. The 2026-04-24 owner sign-off (§13) ratified
the tiered model below; no other configuration is supported.

### 5.1 CC path (datacenter Hopper / Blackwell)

Genesis embeds:

- The NVIDIA device-attestation CA root public key(s).
- A list of accepted NVIDIA attestation-chain issuers.
- A minimum firmware / driver floor per supported architecture
  (Hopper SM90, Blackwell SM100).

Live NGC HTTP attestation is **not used.** The validator SLO
(`< 100 ms` per proof) does not tolerate a synchronous HTTPS
round-trip to NVIDIA's attestation service per proof, and a
chain halt caused by an NVIDIA service outage is unacceptable.
Root rotation handled the same way every pinned-root system
handles it: a governance-gated chain-config update committing
the new root, activated at a future height.

Deferred only insofar as **real-world `nvtrust` bundle framing**
is concerned; see §12.1.

### 5.2 Consumer GPU path — on-chain operator registry

Schema (`pkg/mining/enrollment/types.go`):

```
node_id:     UTF-8 string, ≤ 64 bytes
gpu_uuid:    exact UUID string from `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=uuid`
pub_key:     ed25519 public key of the operator
hmac_key:    32 random bytes, shared secret operator↔registry
stake_dust:  uint64; ≥ MinEnrollStakeDust at enrollment
```

Enrollment lifecycle:

1. Operator generates an HMAC key locally (e.g. via
   `QSDminer-console --gen-hmac-key=PATH`).
2. Operator submits `QSD/enroll/v1` transaction carrying
   `(node_id, gpu_uuid, pub_key, hmac_key_commitment)` and
   locking `MinEnrollStakeDust` at the validator's
   `EnrollmentApplier`. Mempool admission: stateless validation
   via `enrollment.AdmissionChecker` in
   [`pkg/mining/enrollment/admit.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/enrollment/admit.go);
   chain-side state mutation in
   [`pkg/chain.EnrollmentApplier`](../../source/pkg/chain/enroll_apply.go).
3. From then on, every proof the miner emits carries a
   `nvidia-hmac-v1` bundle signed with that key.
4. Operators or governance can revoke a `node_id` via
   `QSD/unenroll/v1`. Stake bonds for `UnbondWindow` (default
   30 d at v2 genesis); `BlockProducer.OnSealedBlock` auto-
   sweeps matured records and releases the `gpu_uuid` so the
   physical card can be re-enrolled by a fresh `node_id`.

**Why this is not cryptographically airtight.** An operator with
a legitimately-registered `(node_id, gpu_uuid, hmac_key)` tuple
can lend their HMAC key to an accomplice running on an AMD GPU
that reports a fake `gpu_uuid`. The verifier cannot distinguish.
This is an *economic* lock, not a *cryptographic* one for
consumer cards: the Tensor-Core PoW mixin (§4) makes the AMD
bypass uneconomic, and the stake-at-enrollment makes Sybil
attacks expensive (10 CELL × N keys, plus `freshness-cheat`/
`forged-attestation`/`double-mining` slashing risk).

### 5.3 Deny-list

Genesis embeds a deny-list of GPU name substrings that must not
appear in any `nvidia-hmac-v1` bundle (`bundle.gpu_name`).
Initially empty. Governance can append strings (e.g. a future
revelation that a particular card model has a driver bypass
attackers are abusing). Enforcement: §3.3 step 7.

### 5.4 Stake-at-enrollment (anti-Sybil)

`MinEnrollStakeDust = 10 * 100_000_000` dust = **10 CELL**.
Ratified 2026-04-24 (§13.2). Governance may adjust post-launch
via the chain-config delta mechanism. Enforced by
[`pkg/mining/fork.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/fork.go) and the
mempool admission gate; defended by
[`pkg/chain/slash_apply.go`](../../source/pkg/chain/slash_apply.go)'s
`SlashApplier.AutoRevokeMinStakeDust` which automatically
revokes any record drained below the threshold.

---

## 6. Freshness window & nonce issuance

### 6.1 The problem

Without a freshness mechanism, a miner could record one valid
attestation bundle and replay it forever. The attestation check
would pass but the bundle conveys no evidence about the specific
proof it's paired with.

### 6.2 The solution

`FRESHNESS_WINDOW = 60 s`. Ratified 2026-04-24 (§13.3).
Validator nonce ring buffer retention: `2 × FRESHNESS_WINDOW =
120 s`.

1. Every validator exposes
   `GET /api/v1/mining/challenge` (§3.3). Response: 32-byte
   random nonce + issued-at timestamp + signature over both by
   the validator's challenge signing key.
2. A miner fetches a challenge before starting a round and
   embeds the exact `(nonce, issued_at)` in its
   `Attestation.Nonce` / `Attestation.IssuedAt`.
3. A proof is stale if `issued_at + FRESHNESS_WINDOW < now`.
4. A validator can verify a challenge it didn't issue by
   checking the issuer's signature — any validator's challenge
   is accepted as long as it's within the freshness window.
   This prevents a single-validator DoS where the network stalls
   because one validator's challenge service is down.

### 6.3 Replay store

Validators remember `(node_id, nonce)` (or `(device_uuid, nonce)`
for the CC path) for `2 × FRESHNESS_WINDOW`. A proof reusing a
nonce already seen → reject.

---

## 7. Verifier

### 7.1 Acceptance flow

```go
// pkg/mining/verifier.go (v2). The attestation gate runs first
// after validateShape so we reject bad attestations before
// spending CPU on the DAG walk.
func (v *Verifier) Verify(p Proof, …) error {
    if err := p.validateShape(); err != nil { return err }

    if p.Height >= ForkV2Height {
        if err := v.verifyAttestation(p); err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("v2 attestation: %w", err)
        }
    }
    // existing DAG walk, target check, etc…
    return nil
}

func (v *Verifier) verifyAttestation(p Proof) error {
    a := p.Attestation
    if a.Type == "" { return ErrAttestationRequired }
    return v.dispatcher.Verify(p, a)
}
```

Dispatcher: `pkg/mining/attest/dispatcher.go` — type-keyed
registry mapping `Attestation.Type` to a concrete
`AttestationVerifier`.

### 7.2 Shipped packages

| Package | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`pkg/mining/attest/cc/`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/cc/) | NVIDIA CC cert-chain + AIK quote verification | **Shipped.** 28 unit tests, deterministic in-process test vectors. |
| [`pkg/mining/attest/hmac/`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/hmac/) | Consumer-GPU HMAC verification + registry lookup | **Shipped.** Wired through `attest.ProductionConfig.HMACConfig`. |
| [`pkg/mining/attest/dispatcher.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/dispatcher.go) | Type-keyed verifier registry | **Shipped.** |
| [`pkg/mining/challenge/`](../../source/pkg/mining/challenge/) | Validator-issued nonce challenge crypto | **Shipped.** |
| [`pkg/mining/enrollment/`](../../source/pkg/mining/enrollment/) | On-chain operator registry, admission gate, sweep | **Shipped.** |
| [`pkg/mining/slashing/`](../../source/pkg/mining/slashing/) | Slashing data model + dispatcher + admission | **Shipped** (`forged-attestation` + `double-mining` + `freshness-cheat`); the freshness-cheat verifier ships with a `BlockInclusionWitness` abstraction whose production default rejects pending BFT finality (§12.3). |
| [`pkg/governance/chainparams/`](../../source/pkg/governance/chainparams/) | `QSD/gov/v1` parameter-tuning tx type, registry, ParamStore, admission | **Shipped.** Three tunables: `reward_bps`, `auto_revoke_min_stake_dust`, `fork_v2_tc_height`. See §9.4 + §4 / §12.2. |
| [`pkg/chain/gov_apply.go`](../../source/pkg/chain/gov_apply.go) | Chain-side `GovApplier` adapter routing `QSD/gov/v1` txs | **Shipped.** Stages → promotes via `SealedBlockHook`. |

### 7.3 Test vectors

Phase 2c-iv ships test vectors **inline, not as testdata files**
— [`pkg/mining/attest/cc/testvectors.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/attest/cc/testvectors.go)
is a deterministic in-process generator (seeded PRNG, fresh
self-signed root + AIK leaf per call) so CI runs on machines
without GPU hardware. Coverage:

- 1 happy path
- 13 negative cases: tampered AIK signature, wrong root, expired
  leaf, nonce mismatch, issued_at mismatch, miner_addr/mix_digest
  preimage tamper, stale, future-dated, below firmware floor,
  below driver floor, replay through `NonceStore`, malformed
  base64, unknown JSON field, over-length cert chain.

When NVIDIA-issued real-world H100 / B100 bundles become
available, the swap is a single `ParseBundle` reimplementation
— the verifier code does not change.

---

## 8. On-chain enrollment & slashing

The §3 attestation gate is the *consensus* rule. To make the
NVIDIA lock observable and enforceable, v2 adds an on-chain
registry (enrollment) and a punishment surface (slashing) that
let any node that *witnesses* a forged proof drain the offender's
stake without trusting any single validator.

### 8.1 Enrollment

Wire types in
[`pkg/mining/enrollment/types.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/enrollment/types.go):

```go
type EnrollPayload struct {
    NodeID     string
    GPUUUID    string
    PubKey     []byte // ed25519
    HMACKey    []byte // 32 random bytes
    StakeDust  uint64 // ≥ MinEnrollStakeDust
    ContractID = "QSD/enroll/v1"
}

type UnenrollPayload struct {
    NodeID     string
    ContractID = "QSD/unenroll/v1"
}

type EnrollmentRecord struct {
    NodeID, GPUUUID, Owner string
    PubKey, HMACKey        []byte
    StakeDust              uint64
    EnrolledAtHeight       uint64
    RevokedAtHeight        uint64 // 0 == active
    UnbondMaturesAtHeight  uint64 // 0 == active
}
```

Stateless mempool admission:
[`pkg/mining/enrollment/admit.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/enrollment/admit.go)
(`AdmissionChecker`).

Stateful chain-side applier:
[`pkg/chain/enroll_apply.go`](../../source/pkg/chain/enroll_apply.go)
(`EnrollmentApplier`), composed via
[`pkg/chain/applier.go`](../../source/pkg/chain/applier.go)
(`EnrollmentAwareApplier`) into the block producer's state
transition pipeline.

Auto-sweep at unbond maturity:
`BlockProducer.OnSealedBlock = SealedBlockHook(...)`. Matured
`UnbondMaturesAtHeight ≤ height` records release stake to the
operator's account and free the `gpu_uuid` binding for fresh
re-enrollment.

### 8.2 Slashing

Wire types in
[`pkg/mining/slashing/types.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/slashing/types.go):

```go
const ContractID = "QSD/slash/v1"

type EvidenceKind string

const (
    EvidenceKindForgedAttestation EvidenceKind = "forged-attestation"
    EvidenceKindDoubleMining      EvidenceKind = "double-mining"
    EvidenceKindFreshnessCheat    EvidenceKind = "freshness-cheat"
)

type SlashPayload struct {
    Offender, Slasher string
    Kind              EvidenceKind
    EvidenceBlob      []byte
    SlashAmountDust   uint64
    Memo              string
}
```

Concrete `EvidenceVerifier` implementations:

| Kind | Detects | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `forged-attestation` | An HMAC bundle whose MAC fails verification, whose `gpu_uuid` mismatches the enrolled record, whose `challenge_bind` mismatches the proof, or whose `gpu_name` matches the deny-list. | **Shipped** in [`pkg/mining/slashing/forgedattest`](../../source/pkg/mining/slashing/forgedattest/). |
| `double-mining` | Two distinct accepted proofs from the same `(node_id, epoch, height)`, both crypto-valid under the registered HMAC key. | **Shipped** in [`pkg/mining/slashing/doublemining`](../../source/pkg/mining/slashing/doublemining/). Encoder canonicalises proof order so two slashers observing the same equivocation produce byte-identical evidence. |
| `freshness-cheat` | A proof whose `bundle.issued_at` is older than `FRESHNESS_WINDOW + grace` (default 60 s + 30 s) when measured against the chain block-time of the inclusion height, i.e. retroactive evidence of validator collusion or clock skew. | **Shipped** in [`pkg/mining/slashing/freshnesscheat`](../../source/pkg/mining/slashing/freshnesscheat/). The verifier is fully implemented; on-chain acceptance is gated on the injected `BlockInclusionWitness`. Production binaries ship `RejectAllWitness` (every slash rejected with a kind-specific `ErrEvidenceVerification`), pending the BFT-finality dependency in §12.3. Testnets MAY wire `TrustingTestWitness` to exercise the path end-to-end. |

Production dispatcher:
[`pkg/mining/slashing/production.go`](../../source/pkg/mining/slashing/production.go).

#### Chain-side applier

[`pkg/chain/slash_apply.go`](../../source/pkg/chain/slash_apply.go)
(`SlashApplier`):

1. Decodes `SlashPayload` and dispatches to the matching
   `EvidenceVerifier`.
2. Fingerprints the evidence (`(node_id, evidence_hash)`) and
   rejects duplicates → per-fingerprint replay protection.
3. Drains `min(SlashAmountDust, record.StakeDust)` from the
   offender's bonded stake.
4. Pays a configurable `RewardBPS` fraction (capped at
   `SlashRewardCap = 5000` bps = 50%) to the slasher; burns the
   rest.
5. **Auto-revoke under-bonded records:** if the post-slash stake
   is `< AutoRevokeMinStakeDust` (default `MinEnrollStakeDust`),
   `enrollment.InMemoryState.RevokeIfUnderBonded` retires the
   record at the standard unbond window. This closes the
   "slash-to-zero, keep mining for free" loophole. Set to 0 to
   disable.

## 9. Operator surface

### 9.1 HTTP

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/mining/challenge` | GET | Issue a fresh nonce challenge for §3.3 / §6. | `pkg/api/handlers.go` |
| `/api/v1/mining/enroll` | POST | Submit `QSD/enroll/v1` transaction. | `pkg/api/handlers_enroll.go` |
| `/api/v1/mining/unenroll` | POST | Submit `QSD/unenroll/v1` transaction. | `pkg/api/handlers_enroll.go` |
| `/api/v1/mining/slash` | POST | Submit `QSD/slash/v1` transaction. | `pkg/api/handlers_slashing.go` |
| `/api/v1/mining/slash/{tx_id}` | GET | Read sanitised slash receipt (FIFO-bounded in-memory store). | `pkg/api/handlers_slash_query.go` |
| `/api/v1/mining/enrollment/{node_id}` | GET | Read sanitised enrollment view (`phase`, `slashable`; HMAC key never leaks). | `pkg/api/handlers_enrollment_query.go` |
| `/api/v1/mining/enrollments?cursor=&limit=&phase=` | GET | Paginated list of enrollments, lexicographic by node_id, with `Phase` filter. | `pkg/api/handlers_enrollment_list.go` |

All endpoints wired in
[`internal/v2wiring/v2wiring.go`](../../source/internal/v2wiring/v2wiring.go)
(see §9.5). Each endpoint returns 503 until its `Set*` is called,
so a misconfigured boot fails loudly rather than silently
degrading.

### 9.2 CLI — `QSDcli`

Source: [`cmd/QSDcli/`](../../source/cmd/QSDcli/). Subcommands:

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `QSDcli enroll` | Build + submit `QSD/enroll/v1`. |
| `QSDcli unenroll` | Build + submit `QSD/unenroll/v1`. |
| `QSDcli slash` | Build + submit `QSD/slash/v1` (consumes evidence-bundle bytes). |
| `QSDcli enrollment-status` | Query `/api/v1/mining/enrollment/{node_id}`. |
| `QSDcli enrollments` | Paginated list, with `--phase`, `--limit`, `--cursor`, `--all` flags. |
| `QSDcli slash-receipt` | Query `/api/v1/mining/slash/{tx_id}`. |
| `QSDcli slash-helper {forged-attestation,double-mining,inspect}` | Offline evidence-bundle assembly (see §9.3). |
| `QSDcli watch enrollments [--phase --node-id --interval --json --once --include-existing]` | Stream phase-change / stake-delta events. Polling-only, no key required. Single-node and list modes. Emits `new`/`transition`/`stake_delta`/`dropped`/`error` events on stdout (human or JSON-Lines). See [`MINER_QUICKSTART.md` "Streaming phase-change events"](./MINER_QUICKSTART.md#streaming-phase-change-events-with-QSDcli-watch). |
| `QSDcli watch slashes [--tx-id --tx-ids-file --interval --json --once --include-pending --exit-on-resolved]` | Stream slash-receipt resolution events for a caller-supplied set of slash tx ids. Polling-only, no key required. Emits `slash_resolved`/`slash_pending`/`slash_evicted`/`slash_outcome_change`/`error` events. Default first-poll behaviour emits only already-resolved receipts; `--include-pending` echoes every still-pending tx each cycle; `--exit-on-resolved` terminates once every tracked tx has reached a terminal outcome (good for CI / cron). See [`MINER_QUICKSTART.md` "Streaming slash-receipt events"](./MINER_QUICKSTART.md#streaming-slash-receipt-events-with-QSDcli-watch-slashes). |
| `QSDcli watch params [--param --interval --json --once --include-existing]` | Stream governance-parameter staging / activation events. Polls `GET /api/v1/governance/params` and diffs successive snapshots. Polling-only, no key required. Emits `param_staged`/`param_superseded`/`param_activated`/`param_removed`/`param_authorities_changed`/`error` events on stdout (human or JSON-Lines). `--param=NAME` narrows the stream to a single registered param; `--include-existing` synthesises a `param_staged` event for every pending change visible at the first poll. Authorities and the off-chain multisig surface live in §9.4. |

The CLI builds canonical payloads through `pkg/mining/{enrollment,
slashing}` so it shares the exact codec the mempool admission
gate validates against — no parallel hand-rolled JSON path.

### 9.3 Slash-helper — offline evidence-bundle assembly

[`cmd/QSDcli/slash_helper.go`](../../source/cmd/QSDcli/slash_helper.go)
+ [`cmd/QSDcli/slash_helper_test.go`](../../source/cmd/QSDcli/slash_helper_test.go).
Three subcommands produce / decode the canonical `EvidenceBlob`
bytes the chain-side `forgedattest` / `doublemining` decoders
consume:

```
QSDcli slash-helper forged-attestation --proof=PATH \
                                        [--fault-class=KIND] \
                                        [--memo=STR] [--node-id=ID] \
                                        [--out=PATH] [--print-cmd]

QSDcli slash-helper double-mining --proof-a=PATH --proof-b=PATH \
                                   [--memo=STR] [--node-id=ID] \
                                   [--out=PATH] [--print-cmd]

QSDcli slash-helper inspect --kind=KIND \
                             (--evidence-file=PATH | --evidence-hex=HEX)
```

Pre-flight checks reject obviously-broken evidence locally
(saves a tx fee on guaranteed `verifier_failed`):

| Check | `forged-attestation` | `double-mining` |
|---|---|---|
| Proof carries `Version=2` | ✓ | ✓ (both) |
| Attestation bundle non-empty | ✓ | — |
| `node_id` matches across inputs | ✓ (--node-id) | ✓ (a vs b) |
| Same `(Epoch, Height)` | — | ✓ |
| Distinct canonical bytes | — | ✓ |

Output defaults to stdout (raw bytes; pipe directly into
`QSDcli slash --evidence-file=-`). `--out=PATH` writes to a
0o600 file. `--print-cmd` emits a copy-pasteable
`QSDcli slash …` snippet on **stderr** (never stdout — keeps
the bytes pipe clean). Encoder ordering is canonicalised in
`double-mining` so two slashers observing the same equivocation
produce byte-identical evidence, preserving chain-side
per-fingerprint replay protection. 21 unit tests cover happy
paths, stdout-write, stderr-only `--print-cmd`, every pre-flight
rejection, encoder round-trip, and `inspect` against
forged-attestation + double-mining blobs supplied as either
`--evidence-file` or `--evidence-hex`.

### 9.4 Governance — runtime parameter tuning (`QSD/gov/v1`)

Source:
[`pkg/governance/chainparams/`](../../source/pkg/governance/chainparams/)
+ [`pkg/chain/gov_apply.go`](../../source/pkg/chain/gov_apply.go)
+ [`cmd/QSDcli/gov_helper.go`](../../source/cmd/QSDcli/gov_helper.go).

Two protocol-economy parameters that previously lived as
construction-time arguments to `chain.SlashApplier` are now
governance-tunable at runtime:

| Param name (wire) | Reader | Bounds | Genesis default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reward_bps` | `SlashApplier.activeRewardBPS()` | `[0, 5000]` (clamped at `chain.SlashRewardCap`) | `cfg.SlashRewardBPS` (binary-supplied) |
| `auto_revoke_min_stake_dust` | `SlashApplier.activeAutoRevokeMinStakeDust()` | `[1·CELL, MIN_ENROLL_STAKE]` | `MIN_ENROLL_STAKE` |
| `fork_v2_tc_height` | runtime `pkg/mining.ForkV2TCHeight()`, repinned by `v2wiring`'s `SealedBlockHook` after each `Promote` (§4 / §12.2) | `[0, math.MaxUint64]` | `cfg.ForkV2TCHeight` (binary-supplied; `nil` = `MaxUint64` = TC disabled) |

Tunable parameters are an explicit whitelist
(`chainparams.Registry`); anything else requires a binary
upgrade. Adding a new tunable lands as a single registry append
plus a chain-side reader — every other layer (admission,
applier, ParamStore, CLI help, metrics labels) auto-discovers
the addition.

#### Wire format

`QSD/gov/v1` `ParamSetPayload`, canonical JSON, encoded into
`mempool.Tx.Payload`:

```json
{
  "kind": "param-set",
  "param": "reward_bps",
  "value": 2500,
  "effective_height": 12345,
  "memo": "post-mortem #14: lower reward share"
}
```

`memo` is bounded at 256 bytes. `DisallowUnknownFields` is set
so wire drift is rejected loudly.

#### Authority model

`chain.GovApplier` is constructed with
`v2wiring.Config.GovernanceAuthorities []string` — a set of
addresses authorised to submit `QSD/gov/v1` txs. Empty slice
**disables** on-chain governance entirely (every gov tx
rejects with `chainparams.ErrGovernanceNotConfigured`); this
is the genesis posture for chains that have not yet bootstrapped
a governance authority. The genesis list is binary-baked, but
the live AuthorityList is now itself rotatable via the
**M-of-N gated `authority-set` payload kind** described
in §9.4.7 — a captured authority cannot unilaterally change
membership.

The off-chain `pkg/governance/{voting,multisig}` package
remains useful for off-chain proposal coordination, but on-
chain rotations no longer require a binary redeploy: each
authority submits a vote tx and the chain stages the
rotation once threshold votes accumulate.

#### Activation

The tx field `effective_height` MUST satisfy:

```
currentHeight ≤ effective_height ≤ currentHeight + MaxActivationDelay
```

with `MaxActivationDelay = 86,400 blocks (~3 days at 3-second
block time)`. The applier stages the change in a per-param
"pending" slot; the `SealedBlockHook` calls
`GovApplier.PromotePending(blockHeight)` after each block,
which atomically promotes any pending changes whose
`effective_height` has been reached. Promotion order is
deterministic across nodes (by `effective_height` ascending,
then by name ascending). Setting
`effective_height == currentHeight` is the "apply at the next
block" knob.

One pending change per parameter at a time; subsequent
submissions for the same parameter SUPERSEDE the prior pending
entry (with a `param-superseded` event for audit trails).

#### Mempool admission

`chainparams.AdmissionChecker` is layered above the slashing
admission gate, mirroring the slashing > enrollment > base
stack:

```go
pool.SetAdmissionChecker(
    chainparams.AdmissionChecker(
        slashing.AdmissionChecker(
            enrollment.AdmissionChecker(baseAdmit))))
```

Admission performs every stateless check: kind tag, registry
membership, bounds, memo cap, fee floor. Stateful checks
(authority list, height window) live in the applier where
`AccountStore` and `currentHeight` are available.

#### Observability

Four Prometheus counters / gauges, all exported by
`pkg/monitoring/gov_metrics.go`:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QSD_gov_param_staged_total` | counter | `param` | `QSD/gov/v1` param-set txs accepted, by parameter. |
| `QSD_gov_param_activated_total` | counter | `param` | Staged changes promoted to active by `Promote()`, by parameter. |
| `QSD_gov_param_value` | gauge | `param` | Currently-active value for each governance-tunable parameter. |
| `QSD_gov_param_rejected_total` | counter | `reason` | Param-set txs rejected before staging, by reason (decode, unauthorized, height_in_past, height_too_far, fee_invalid, …). |

Plus four `GovParamEvent` flavours emitted on the
`GovEventPublisher` interface (a separate publisher from
`ChainEventPublisher` so existing slash / enrollment subscribers
do not have to grow a no-op handler):

| Kind | When it fires |
|---|---|
| `param-staged` | once per accepted gov tx |
| `param-superseded` | when the staged change overwrites a prior pending entry for the same parameter |
| `param-activated` | when `Promote(height)` flips pending → active |
| `param-rejected` | once per pre-mutation rejection, with `RejectReason` matching the metrics enum |

#### HTTP read API

Operators, dashboards, and `QSDcli watch params` consume two
read-only endpoints, both registered unconditionally and
returning **503 Service Unavailable** until
`api.SetGovernanceProvider(...)` is called by `internal/v2wiring`
at boot:

| Method + path | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/governance/params` | `GovernanceParamsView` | Full snapshot: `active` (param→value), `pending[]` sorted by `(effective_height ASC, param ASC)`, `registry[]` sorted by `name`, `authorities[]` sorted ASC, `governance_enabled` bool. Empty slices/maps are normalised to `[]` / `{}` so diff-driven consumers don't branch on null. |
| `GET /api/v1/governance/params/{name}` | `GovernanceParamView` | Single-param view: `active_value`, optional `pending` (omitted when no staged change), `registry` entry. **400** when name is empty or > 64 bytes; **404** when the name is not in the registry. |

Both endpoints are **READ-only**. Submitting a parameter change
goes through the same signed-tx envelope as every other
`QSD/...` ContractID via `POST /api/v1/transactions`, with
payload constructed by `QSDcli gov-helper propose-param`.

#### CLI — `QSDcli gov-helper`

[`cmd/QSDcli/gov_helper.go`](../../source/cmd/QSDcli/gov_helper.go)
ships an offline assembly tool symmetric to `slash-helper`:

```
QSDcli gov-helper propose-param --param=NAME --value=N \
                                  --effective-height=H \
                                  [--memo=STR] [--out=PATH] [--print-cmd]
QSDcli gov-helper params [--json] [--remote]
QSDcli gov-helper inspect (--payload-file=PATH | --payload-hex=HEX)
```

`propose-param` builds a canonical `ParamSetPayload` and writes
the encoded JSON; pre-flight checks mirror the chain-side
admission so an authority sees out-of-bounds / unknown-param
rejections locally before submitting. The produced bytes are
consumed by whatever signing pipeline the authority has
(multisig orchestrator, hardware wallet, etc.) and submitted
via `QSDcli tx … --contract-id=QSD/gov/v1 --payload-file=…`.

`params` lists the registered tunables with bounds and defaults
(table or `--json`). With `--remote`, the offline registry is
merged with the validator's live `/api/v1/governance/params`
snapshot — the table grows `ACTIVE` and `PENDING` columns
(`PENDING` collapses to `value@H+effective_height` when a change
is staged) and a stderr footer reports `governance_enabled`
plus the authority list, so an authority can confirm "yes, my
key is on the list, my proposal will admit" before they
build a payload. `--remote` is best-effort: a 503 / network
error degrades gracefully to the offline view with a stderr
warning.

`inspect` decodes a previously-built payload and pretty-prints
it with the matched registry entry.

#### CLI — `QSDcli watch params`

Polling-only event streamer parallel to `watch enrollments` /
`watch slashes`. Hits `GET /api/v1/governance/params` once per
cycle and diffs successive snapshots; emits one event per
parameter per cycle plus a single `param_authorities_changed`
event per cycle when the validator's authority list shifts.
Same `--interval` / `--once` / `--json` / `--include-existing`
flag surface as the other watchers, plus a `--param=NAME`
filter that narrows the stream to a single registered param.
Event kinds:

| Kind | When it fires |
|---|---|
| `param_staged` | a pending change appeared where none existed (or, with `--include-existing`, on the first poll for every pre-existing pending change) |
| `param_superseded` | a pending entry was replaced by a different pending entry without activating — the "another authority overrode my proposal" lifecycle |
| `param_activated` | an active value changed across two snapshots — the canonical "your proposal landed" signal |
| `param_removed` | a pending entry vanished without activation (defensive; today the chain has no path that produces this, so emitting it loudly surfaces unexpected store churn) |
| `param_authorities_changed` | the validator's reported authority list differs across snapshots (today binary-baked, so this should never fire under normal operation) |
| `error` | a poll cycle failed (network / HTTP / decode); always emitted on stderr in human mode |

Same exit semantics as the other watchers: SIGINT/SIGTERM
returns 0, only initial-snapshot failure exits non-zero.

#### Migration posture

Binaries that have not yet wired `GovernanceAuthorities` keep
the old construction-time-only behaviour: `SlashApplier` reads
from a default-seeded `InMemoryParamStore` (so the read path
is uniform) but the values never change because no
`QSD/gov/v1` tx is ever accepted. Activating governance is a
one-line config edit (populate `GovernanceAuthorities`) and
takes effect at the next boot.

#### Persistence — `GovParamStorePath`

The on-chain `ParamStore` interface (`pkg/governance/chainparams.ParamStore`)
mandates that production implementations persist `active` +
`pending` state across node restarts. The reference
`InMemoryParamStore` is non-persistent on its own; the
`pkg/governance/chainparams/persist.go` companion ships
free functions (`SaveSnapshot`, `LoadOrNew`) that the host
orchestrates from a natural commit boundary.

`internal/v2wiring.Config.GovParamStorePath` is that
orchestration. When set:

- **Boot**: `Wire()` calls `chainparams.LoadOrNew(path)`. The
  file is parsed and replayed into a fresh
  `InMemoryParamStore`; `active` values for unknown params and
  out-of-bounds values are silently dropped (forward/backward
  compat). A version mismatch or malformed JSON returns a
  hard error so the operator notices state corruption rather
  than silently downgrading.
- **Per sealed block**: the `SealedBlockHook` calls
  `chainparams.SaveSnapshot(govStore, path)` AFTER
  `GovApplier.PromotePending` runs. So a snapshot always
  reflects every promotion the chain committed up to and
  including the just-sealed block.
- **Atomic write**: `SaveSnapshot` writes to `<path>.tmp`
  then atomically renames over `<path>` (with a `Remove`
  beforehand on Windows). A crash between Remove and Rename
  leaves `<path>` missing; the next boot's `LoadOrNew`
  treats that as a first-boot scenario, and an operator can
  hand-recover by renaming `<path>.tmp`.
- **Save errors**: surfaced via `Config.LogSnapshotError`;
  the chain continues. Persistence drift on a single block
  recovers on the next save.

When `GovParamStorePath` is empty (default) the store is
in-memory only. That's fine for ephemeral testnets but NOT
acceptable for production: a validator restart loses every
pending change and resets `active` values to the registry
defaults, which is a consensus-divergence risk on multi-node
networks.

Snapshot format (JSON, version-tagged):

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "saved_at": "2026-04-28T16:20:00Z",
  "active": {"reward_bps": 2500, "auto_revoke_min_stake_dust": 1000000000},
  "pending": [
    {"param":"reward_bps","value":3000,"effective_height":12345,
     "submitted_at_height":12000,"authority":"alice","memo":"…"}
  ],
  "authority_proposals": [
    {"op":"add","address":"QSD1new","effective_height":15000,
     "voters":[{"voter":"alice","submitted_at_height":14800}],
     "crossed":false}
  ]
}
```

The current writer always emits `version=2`. The reader
accepts `version` ∈ {1, 2} so v2 binaries replay v1 snapshots
cleanly (the `authority_proposals` field is absent — vote
store boots empty); a v1 binary reading a v2 snapshot is
correctly refused (silently dropping in-flight rotations
across a downgrade is the wrong default). Future bumps
extend the supported range or hard-cut: the load path
refuses unknown versions rather than silently downgrading.

#### 9.4.7 Authority rotation — `authority-set` payload kind

The `QSD/gov/v1` ContractID carries TWO payload kinds —
`param-set` (§9.4.1–9.4.6 above) and `authority-set` (this
subsection). The kind tag is the dispatch discriminator for
both the admission gate
(`chainparams.AdmissionChecker.PeekKind`) and the chain
applier (`chain.GovApplier.ApplyGovTx`).

**Wire format**:

```json
{
  "kind": "authority-set",
  "op":   "add",
  "address": "QSD1new-authority",
  "effective_height": 15000,
  "memo": "onboarding dave per board resolution 2026-04"
}
```

`op ∈ {add, remove}`. `address` is bounded at
`MaxAuthorityAddressLen=128` ASCII-printable bytes (no
whitespace, no control bytes — addresses are compared as
exact strings, so a sloppy trailing newline must reject).
`effective_height` follows the same window as `param-set`:
`[currentHeight, currentHeight + MaxActivationDelay]`.

**M-of-N tally**:

Each tx is one authority's VOTE on a proposal tuple
`(op, address, effective_height)`. Different effective
heights name different proposals, even for the same
address. The chain accumulates votes in
`pkg/governance/chainparams.AuthorityVoteStore`; the
threshold computed at vote-application time is

```
threshold = max(1, N/2 + 1)
```

where `N` is the live AuthorityList size. So:

| N | threshold | comment |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 1 | bootstrap: a single authority can act unilaterally |
| 2 | 2 | unanimity |
| 3 | 2 | simple majority |
| 4 | 3 | strict majority |
| 5 | 3 | strict majority |

A captured single authority is no worse than the prior
posture (they could already grief the chain). Past `N=1`,
the strictly-greater-than-half rule keeps a captured
minority from rotating themselves into majority.

**Activation**:

When the Mth vote crosses the threshold, the proposal is
flagged `Crossed=true` (sticky — never un-crosses on
subsequent votes). The post-seal `PromotePending(height)`
hook then activates every Crossed proposal whose
`effective_height` has been reached:

- `add` → inserts the address into the live AuthorityList
  under `authorityMu`. A subsequent param-set or
  authority-set tx from the new authority is now eligible.
- `remove` → drops the address from the AuthorityList.
  ALSO drops every still-OPEN proposal's vote cast by the
  removed authority; if a proposal loses its last voter
  it is abandoned (an `authority-abandoned` event records
  it). Then `RecomputeCrossed` re-evaluates open
  proposals against the new (smaller) threshold — a
  proposal that was one vote short under the old `N` may
  now satisfy the smaller `N`.
- `remove` that would empty the AuthorityList → REFUSED at
  promotion. An `authority-rejected` event with reason
  `authority_would_empty` is emitted; governance cannot
  rotate itself into the disabled posture from on-chain.

**Stateless validation** (admit gate):

- `kind == authority-set`
- `op ∈ {add, remove}`
- `address` non-empty, ≤128 bytes, ASCII-printable
- `effective_height > 0`
- `len(memo) ≤ 256`
- `Fee > 0` (nonce accounting)

**Stateful validation** (applier):

- `tx.Sender ∈ AuthorityList` (otherwise `ErrUnauthorized`)
- `effective_height ∈ [currentHeight, currentHeight + MaxActivationDelay]`
- For `op=add`: target NOT already on AuthorityList
  (`ErrAuthorityAlreadyPresent`)
- For `op=remove`: target IS on AuthorityList
  (`ErrAuthorityNotPresent`)
- `tx.Sender` has not voted on this proposal tuple before
  (`ErrDuplicateVote`)

**Events** (`chain.GovEventPublisher.PublishGovAuthority`):

| Kind | When |
|---|---|
| `authority-voted` | fires once per accepted vote tx |
| `authority-staged` | fires exactly once per proposal that crosses threshold |
| `authority-activated` | fires when Promote applies the rotation |
| `authority-abandoned` | fires when an open proposal loses its last voter |
| `authority-rejected` | fires on every pre-mutation rejection |

**Metrics** (`pkg/monitoring/gov_metrics.go`):

| Metric | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QSD_gov_authority_voted_total` | counter | `op` | accepted vote txs per op |
| `QSD_gov_authority_crossed_total` | counter | `op` | threshold crossings per op |
| `QSD_gov_authority_activated_total` | counter | `op` | Promote-driven activations per op |
| `QSD_gov_authority_count` | gauge | — | current AuthorityList size |
| `QSD_gov_authority_rejected_total` | counter | `reason` | rejections by reason (already_present, not_present, would_empty, duplicate_vote, vote_rejected) |

**Persistence**:

Authority proposals + their voter sets ride along in the
`pkg/governance/chainparams` snapshot file at
`Config.GovParamStorePath` (snapshot version 2 — see
the snapshot format above). A node crash between
threshold-crossing and activation replays correctly: the
restored proposal still carries `Crossed=true` and
activates at its original `effective_height`.

**CLI**:

```
QSDcli gov-helper propose-authority \
    --op=add --address=QSD1new \
    --effective-height=15000 \
    --memo="onboarding dave"
```

Emits the canonical-JSON `AuthoritySetPayload` to stdout
(or `--out=PATH`); each authority runs this independently
to produce their vote, then signs + submits via the
operator's normal `QSDcli tx --contract-id=QSD/gov/v1`
pipeline. `QSDcli gov-helper inspect` decodes either
payload kind transparently — it dispatches on the
on-disk `kind` tag.

### 9.5 Production boot wiring (`internal/v2wiring`)

[`internal/v2wiring/v2wiring.go`](../../source/internal/v2wiring/v2wiring.go)
constructs the entire v2 surface in one call ordered before
`chain.NewBlockProducer`:

- `enrollment.NewInMemoryState()` — registry source-of-truth.
- `chain.NewEnrollmentApplier`, `chain.NewEnrollmentAwareApplier`.
- `doublemining.NewProductionSlashingDispatcher`,
  `chain.NewSlashApplier`, `aware.SetSlashApplier(...)` —
  failure here is a hard boot error.
- `monitoring.SetEnrollmentStateProvider(...)` — populates
  the four `QSD_enrollment_*` gauges.
- `pool.SetAdmissionChecker(slashing.AdmissionChecker(
  enrollment.AdmissionChecker(prev)))` — the stacked mempool
  gate. Layer order: slashing > enrollment > base.
- All HTTP `Set*` hooks (mempool, query registry, lister,
  receipt store).

Post-construction `Wired.AttachToProducer(bp)` closes the knot
by setting `SetHeightFn` and `OnSealedBlock = SealedBlockHook(...)`.

The 14-test suite in
[`internal/v2wiring/v2wiring_test.go`](../../source/internal/v2wiring/v2wiring_test.go)
is the contract `cmd/QSD/main.go` must honour. Any drift
between `Wire` and the production boot sequence is caught here,
not on mainnet.

### 9.6 Reference miner — `cmd/QSDminer-console`

Source: [`cmd/QSDminer-console/`](../../source/cmd/QSDminer-console/).
This binary is the v1 reference miner with an opt-in v2
attestation path bolted on — sufficient for testnet
participation pre-`FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT`, replaced by
`cmd/QSD-miner-cuda` (deferred — §12.2) once the Tensor-Core
mixin activates.

Operational flow with `--protocol=v2`:

1. `--gen-hmac-key=PATH` — produces a 0o600 hex key file and
   prints the matching `QSDcli enroll …` snippet.
2. `--setup` — opt-in v2 sub-wizard that drives operators
   end-to-end through key generation → field collection → bond
   command emission.
3. `runLoop` fetches a fresh `/api/v1/mining/challenge`, builds
   an `nvidia-hmac-v1` bundle via `pkg/mining/v2client`, and
   submits a `Version=2` proof.
4. The live console panel shows a `v2 NVIDIA` row carrying
   `node`, `arch`, `attestations`, and `challenge=Ns ago` so
   operators can spot freshness-window drift.
5. A background `EnrollmentPoller` (default 30 s,
   `--enrollment-poll`) queries
   `/api/v1/mining/enrollment/{node_id}` and emits
   `EvEnrollment` events; the panel paints `phase` / `stake` /
   `slashable` and surfaces phase-transition events.
6. A challenge-endpoint outage produces a clear `EvError` and
   refuses to fall back to v1, preventing accidental v1
   submissions to a forked validator.

Coverage gated by `TestIntegration_RunLoop_v2_EndToEnd`.

### 9.7 Observability

The slashing applier and the enrollment applier emit two
parallel observability streams, **both wired through a
dependency-inverted seam (`chain.MetricsRecorder`,
`chain.ChainEventPublisher`) so `pkg/chain` does not import
`pkg/monitoring`** — that import cycle is what historically kept
slashing observability under-instrumented. The seam is
populated automatically when `pkg/monitoring` is loaded into a
binary (`init()` in `pkg/monitoring/chain_recorder.go`); a
binary that does not import `pkg/monitoring` falls back to
`noopRecorder{}` and `NoopEventPublisher{}` and pays no
overhead.

#### 9.6.1 Prometheus metrics

Exposed by `pkg/monitoring/prometheus_scrape.go` on
`/api/metrics/prometheus`. Single-counter convention; deltas are
the operator's responsibility.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QSD_slash_applied_total` | counter | `kind` | Successful slash transitions per evidence kind. |
| `QSD_slash_drained_dust_total` | counter | `kind` | Dust drained from offenders. |
| `QSD_slash_rewarded_dust_total` | counter | — | Dust paid to slashers across all kinds. |
| `QSD_slash_burned_dust_total` | counter | — | Dust burned (not rewarded). |
| `QSD_slash_rejected_total` | counter | `reason` (`verifier_failed`, `evidence_replayed`, `node_not_enrolled`, `decode_failed`, `fee_invalid`, `wrong_contract`, `state_lookup_failed`, `stake_mutation_failed`, `other`) | Per-reason rejection. |
| `QSD_slash_auto_revoked_total` | counter | `reason` (`fully_drained`, `under_bonded`) | Auto-revokes (§8.2). |
| `QSD_enrollment_applied_total` | counter | — | Successful enroll txs. |
| `QSD_unenrollment_applied_total` | counter | — | Successful unenroll txs. |
| `QSD_enrollment_rejected_total` | counter | `reason` | Per-reason enroll rejection. |
| `QSD_unenrollment_rejected_total` | counter | `reason` (incl. `not_enrolled`) | Per-reason unenroll rejection. |
| `QSD_enrollment_unbond_swept_total` | counter | — | Matured unbond windows. |
| `QSD_enrollment_active_count` | gauge | — | Records where `Active() == true`. |
| `QSD_enrollment_bonded_dust` | gauge | — | Sum of `StakeDust` across active records. |
| `QSD_enrollment_pending_unbond_count` | gauge | — | Revoked records whose unbond window has not yet matured. |
| `QSD_enrollment_pending_unbond_dust` | gauge | — | Dust still locked in pending-unbond records. |

Gauges are callback-driven via
`monitoring.SetEnrollmentStateProvider(...)` — one mutex
acquisition per scrape, O(n) in active miners. Without
enrollment, the provider is unset and the gauges read 0.

Alert rules: `deploy/observability/QSD-mining-rules.yml`
(checked by `promtool` in CI).

#### 9.6.2 Structured events

[`pkg/chain/events.go`](../../source/pkg/chain/events.go) defines
`MiningSlashEvent` and `EnrollmentEvent`. Both are published via
`ChainEventPublisher`; default is `NoopEventPublisher{}`.
Production deployments attach a publisher (Kafka, NATS, on-chain
log emitter, audit sink) at construction.
`CompositePublisher` lets multiple sinks subscribe.

Both layers share the same canonical reason-tag string set
(`SlashRejectReason*`, `EnrollRejectReason*`) so a metric spike
on `QSD_slash_rejected_total{reason="evidence_replayed"}` maps
1:1 onto the corresponding `MiningSlashEvent` records in the
audit sink.

## 10. Activation mechanics — hard fork

### 10.1 Summary

Testnet reset at a coordinated wall-clock moment. Block 0 of v2
is a fresh genesis committing: the v2 protocol version, the
NVIDIA CC root material, the initial operator registry (empty),
the deny-list (empty), and `MinEnrollStakeDust`.

### 10.2 Genesis file extension

`cmd/genesis-ceremony/main.go::Bundle` adds (at the end of the
struct, so v1 fixtures deserialise zero-valued):

```go
SchemaVersion        int                     `json:"schema_version"`
NvidiaCCRoots        []string                `json:"nvidia_cc_roots_pem"`
NvidiaCCMinFirmware  map[string]string       `json:"nvidia_cc_min_fw"`
OperatorRegistry     []RegistryEntry         `json:"operator_registry"`
GPUDenyList          []string                `json:"gpu_deny_list"`
MinEnrollStake       uint64                  `json:"min_enroll_stake_dust"`
ForkV2Params         ForkV2Params            `json:"fork_v2_params"`
```

`SchemaVersion` goes from `1` (implicit) to `2`. `VerifyBundle`
rejects a `SchemaVersion=2` bundle with zero-length
`NvidiaCCRoots`.

### 10.3 Pre-fork state disposition

All pre-fork state is discarded. The v2 genesis block is height
0. Pre-fork wallets are invalidated. Consistent with the
2026-04-24 owner sign-off (§13.4) that the testnet has no real
users.

### 10.4 Retirement of v1 binaries

At the same commit that ships `cmd/QSD-miner-cuda` (deferred —
§12.2):

- `cmd/QSDminer/` — removed.
- `cmd/QSDminer-console/` — removed (current opt-in v2 path
  retires with the binary).
- `scripts/install-QSDminer-console.*` — already removed in
  Phase 0 (`19e756a`).
- `QSD/Dockerfile.miner-console` — already removed in Phase 0.
- `QSD/Dockerfile.miner` — retained, renamed to
  `QSD/Dockerfile.QSD-miner-cuda`.
- New `cmd/QSD-miner-cuda/` ships with the fork commit.

Until then, `cmd/QSDminer-console` remains the reference miner
for testnet v2 attestation participation (§9.6).

### 10.5 Backward compatibility — `ComputeMixDigestV1`

The v1 PoW is renamed `ComputeMixDigestV1` and kept in-tree for
audit, protocol-conformance tests, and any future soft-unlock if
governance ever wants to re-enable non-NVIDIA mining.

---

## 11. Attacker model

### 11.1 In-scope threats

1. **CPU-only miner.** Rejected by the attestation gate; even if
   a rogue validator accepts it, the proof takes ~250x longer to
   compute on a CPU than on an NVIDIA GPU (§4.4) once the
   mixin lands. Pre-mixin: rejected on attestation alone.
2. **AMD / Intel GPU with forged `nvidia-smi` output.** The
   verifier does not trust `nvidia-smi` output directly; it
   trusts the HMAC over it. The HMAC key binds to a registered
   `(node_id, gpu_uuid)`. To mine from an AMD GPU the attacker
   needs a real registered NVIDIA GPU's HMAC key. If they have
   that, the registered operator is running two miners from one
   key — detectable as `double-mining` evidence (§8.2) and
   slashable.
3. **Nonce replay.** Prevented by `FRESHNESS_WINDOW` and the
   validator's nonce ring buffer (§6).
4. **Stale proof.** Same mitigation.
5. **Rogue validator accepting unattested proofs.** Such a
   validator is in consensus minority if >50% honest, so its
   proposed blocks lose in the PoE+BFT commit round. If it is
   the honest majority, the chain has a bigger problem than the
   attestation rule.
6. **Sybil enrollment.** `MinEnrollStakeDust` puts a Cell cost
   on creating many fake `node_id`s.
7. **HMAC key leak / rental.** Detectable as `forged-
   attestation` (gpu_uuid mismatch) or `double-mining`
   (equivocation under the same key) and slashable. Stake bonds
   the key to honest behaviour.

### 11.2 Out-of-scope threats

1. **NVIDIA CA compromise.** If NVIDIA's attestation root is
   compromised, every NVIDIA-CC-based chain world-wide has a
   problem. Mitigation: governance-driven root rotation via
   chain-config delta.
2. **Operator leaks their HMAC key publicly.** Revocable
   on-chain. Before revocation clears, the attacker mines from
   the operator's identity; the operator loses reputation and
   staked Cell. The attacker can't redirect rewards because
   `miner_addr` is HMAC'd over.
3. **Side-channel attack on an operator's TPM / key storage.**
   Out of scope for consensus; same issue as every PoS chain's
   validator key.

---

## 12. Deferred work register

Work that v2 reserves wire-room for but does not yet ship.
None of it blocks v2 activation; all of it is upgradable
behind feature gates.

### 12.1 Real-world `nvtrust` bundle framing for `nvidia-cc-v1`

`pkg/mining/attest/cc/` ships a Go-native `cc.Bundle` shape
that mirrors what an `nvtrust` quote contains (cert chain +
AIK signature over the spec preimage + PCR-equivalent
versions). The verifier flow (§3.2) is consensus-complete.
What's deferred:

- **NVIDIA-issued real-world test vectors.** Determinism in
  `cc/testvectors.go` is enough for CI and protocol regression
  testing, but a real H100 / B100 produces an AIK quote whose
  on-the-wire framing is NVIDIA-proprietary. The seam to swap
  in real `nvtrust` framing is a single `ParseBundle`
  reimplementation; the verifier code does NOT change.
- **Genesis-pinned NVIDIA root rotation.** `VerifierConfig.PinnedRoots`
  is plumbed end-to-end; ratifying the actual NVIDIA-issued
  Hopper/Blackwell root cert at v2 fork-time is a separate
  governance decision.
- **CUDA-side miner integration.** Once `cmd/QSD-miner-cuda`
  ships (§12.2), it produces live CC bundles using the
  on-host nvtrust SDK; today only `cmd/QSDminer-console`
  produces v2 attestations and it produces `nvidia-hmac-v1`
  only.

Hard external dependencies: NVIDIA NGC Attestation Service
contract; physical Hopper / Blackwell GPU for swap-in
test vectors. Estimated remaining work post-hardware: **~5
days** (down from the original ~8 — verifier pipeline is
already done).

### 12.2 Tensor-Core PoW kernel — reference + height gate shipped, CUDA deferred

Specified in §4. Three deliverables, two shipped:

1. ~~A pure-Go validator-side reference impl in
   `pkg/mining/pow/v2/`.~~ — **SHIPPED.** Locks the byte-exact
   semantics of §4.2 (matrix expansion via SHAKE256, FP16
   endianness, NaN canonicalization, strict left-to-right FP32
   accumulation). Includes an exhaustive 16-bit FP16 round-trip
   test, an identity-matmul test, a known-row hand-computed
   matmul test, a determinism test, a v1≠v2 sanity test, an
   avalanche/diffusion test, and a frozen golden mix-digest
   vector that any future CUDA miner MUST match bit-exact. This
   is the conformance bar.

   ~~**Wire reference into the verifier behind
   `FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT`.**~~ — **SHIPPED.** A runtime-settable
   gate (`pkg/mining.ForkV2TCHeight()` /
   `SetForkV2TCHeight()` / `IsV2TC(height)`) routes Step 10 of
   `Verifier.Verify` and the per-attempt loop of `Solve` through
   either the v1 walk or the v2 mixin based on the proof's
   block height. The default is `math.MaxUint64` (TC disabled),
   so existing behaviour is unchanged until a network operator
   explicitly opts in.

   ~~**Operational deployment: governance + genesis-config
   wiring for `fork_v2_tc_height`.**~~ — **SHIPPED.** The
   activation height is now a registered governance parameter
   (`chainparams.ParamForkV2TCHeight`, bounds `[0, MaxUint64]`,
   default `MaxUint64`). At chain init `v2wiring.Wire()` reads
   the active value from the `ParamStore` and pins it into
   `pkg/mining` via `SetForkV2TCHeight`; after every
   `PromotePending` in the `SealedBlockHook` it re-pins from
   the (possibly just-promoted) store value, so a successful
   `QSD/gov/v1` `param-set` tx makes the new fork height
   visible to the verifier on the very next sealed block —
   without a binary restart. A genesis-seed field
   (`v2wiring.Config.ForkV2TCHeight *uint64`) lets operators
   bake an initial activation into the genesis config; the
   snapshot replay path takes precedence over the seed on
   restart so the chain's committed governance history
   cannot be silently overwritten by a config change.

   Boundary semantics
   (`pkg/mining/verifier_v2tc_test.go`):

   - **Default (TC disabled)**: every proof verifies under v1;
     all pre-existing verifier tests keep passing untouched.
   - **Post-TC happy path**: with `SetForkV2TCHeight(0)`, both
     `Solve` and `Verify` route through the powv2 mixin and the
     proof validates end-to-end.
   - **v1 mix at post-TC height**: rejected with `ReasonWork`
     and message `mix_digest mismatch` — soft-tightening fork
     correct outcome.
   - **v2 mix at pre-TC height**: rejected symmetrically.
   - **Boundary inclusivity**: `IsV2TC(H)` is `false` at
     `H = ForkV2TCHeight() - 1`, `true` at `H = ForkV2TCHeight()`,
     `true` at `H = ForkV2TCHeight() + 1`.

2. A CUDA kernel performing the §4.2 mixin (per nonce attempt,
   16 dependent `mma.m16n8k16.f16` Tensor-Core ops over the
   matrix expanded from the running mix). The CUDA fast-path
   MUST emulate the reference impl's strict left-to-right
   FP32 accumulation order — naive WMMA tree-reduction will
   diverge on the last bit and produce wrong mix-digests. (See
   §4.2.3.) **DEFERRED** until the CUDA build chain is in CI.

3. A calibration suite that pins difficulty so an RTX 4090
   hits ~1 block / 30 s on a ~1000-validator testnet (numbers
   TBD against real hardware). **DEFERRED.**

Hard external dependencies for (2)/(3): working CUDA Toolkit
12.x in CI (self-hosted GPU runner OR cross-compile + offline
smoke test); at least one RTX 4090 for difficulty calibration.
The mixin is gated behind a second fork height
(`FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT`) so it can activate as a soft-rejection
fork (validators get stricter), no chain reset required.

`mma.m16n8k16.f16` is Ampere+ only — Turing miners (RTX
20-series) cannot mine v2 even with a CUDA build. We owe
miners a deprecation notice for pre-Ampere cards before the
fork.

Estimated remaining work for the CUDA kernel + calibration:
**~10 days** post-hardware.

### 12.3 `freshness-cheat` slasher — verifier shipped, witness deferred

Detects a proof whose `bundle.issued_at` is older than
`FRESHNESS_WINDOW + grace` measured against the chain
block-time of the inclusion height (i.e. retroactive evidence
of validator collusion or clock skew). The verifier itself is
**shipped** in
[`pkg/mining/slashing/freshnesscheat`](../../source/pkg/mining/slashing/freshnesscheat/),
along with a `QSDcli slash-helper freshness-cheat`
subcommand that constructs evidence locally with full
client-side validation.

What is still deferred is the `BlockInclusionWitness`
collaborator that authenticates the slasher's claimed
`(height, block_time, proof_id)` tuple. Without BFT finality
(or an equivalent quorum-attested block-header feed) there is
no chain-internal way to certify such a tuple, so production
binaries wire `freshnesscheat.RejectAllWitness{}`: the verifier
runs all of its structural / staleness / registry-binding
checks, then rejects the slash with a kind-specific
`ErrEvidenceVerification` ("witness layer not configured").
End-user behaviour matches the previous `StubVerifier` posture
but with materially better diagnostics, and the path is fully
exercised on testnets that wire
`freshnesscheat.TrustingTestWitness{}`.

Once BFT finality lands, a real `quorum.HeaderWitness` (or
similar) implementation plugs into the same interface and
freshness-cheat starts slashing for real with no other code
changes.

Estimated remaining work: **~2 days** to wire the
quorum-header witness once the BFT pipeline exposes finalised
headers.

### 12.4 ~~`QSD/gov/v1` runtime tuning hook~~ — SHIPPED

`SlashApplier.RewardBPS` and `AutoRevokeMinStakeDust` are now
governance-tunable at runtime via the `QSD/gov/v1` transaction
type. See §10 for the complete specification. A binary upgrade
is no longer required to retune these economic parameters; an
authority address on the configured `AuthorityList` submits a
single signed gov tx and the change activates at a chosen
future block height. The operator-facing HTTP read-API surface
(`GET /api/v1/governance/params`,
`GET /api/v1/governance/params/{name}`),
the `QSDcli gov-helper params --remote` live-table render,
and the `QSDcli watch params` event streamer are also
**SHIPPED** — see §9.4 for the full surface.

### 12.5 ~~Multisig-gated authority rotation~~ — SHIPPED

The `QSD/gov/v1` ContractID's `authority-set` payload kind
ships as a second variant alongside `param-set`. Authorities
rotate via on-chain M-of-N votes (threshold = `N/2 + 1`,
minimum 1) on `(op, address, effective_height)` tuples;
crossed proposals stage and activate at the chosen height,
with full persistence across snapshots (snapshot version 2,
backwards-compatible with v1) and a `QSDcli gov-helper
propose-authority` CLI surface. See §9.4.7 for the full
specification.

## 13. Historical decision record

### 13.1 Trust-anchor model — RATIFIED

> Tiered. NVIDIA-CC-pinned for Hopper / Blackwell Confidential
> Computing GPUs, plus Registered-operator HMAC for consumer RTX
> cards.

Ratified 2026-04-24, project owner, in-chat decision. Spec
revision: `6826bc4` of `MINING_PROTOCOL_V2_NVIDIA_LOCKED.md`
(now superseded by this doc).

Rationale:

- Keeps consumer NVIDIA GPUs (Turing / Ampere / Ada) eligible to
  mine. Without a consumer path the chain is effectively a
  datacenter-only product.
- Gives CC-capable datacenter GPUs a strictly stronger crypto
  guarantee than the HMAC path. Operators who have paid for CC
  hardware get the attestation value they paid for.
- Implementation cost is manageable — both paths compose with
  existing code (the HMAC path extends
  `pkg/monitoring/nvidia_hmac.go`; the CC path uses `crypto/x509`
  plus a pinned-root genesis extension).

Two `Attestation.Type` values land: `nvidia-cc-v1` and
`nvidia-hmac-v1`. Verifier dispatches on `Attestation.Type`.

### 13.2 `MIN_ENROLL_STAKE` — RATIFIED

> Initial enrollment stake required to register a
> `(node_id, gpu_uuid, hmac_key)` tuple in the
> `nvidia-hmac-v1` operator registry.

Ratified 2026-04-24: **10 CELL.** Encoded as
`MinEnrollStake = 10 * 10^8` dust in the v2 genesis ceremony
bundle.

Rationale:

- Low enough that a miner with roughly one day of pre-mining can
  self-fund enrollment, which keeps onboarding accessible.
- High enough that thousand-GPU Sybil enrollments cost
  10,000 CELL locked for 30 days — comparable to the cost of
  the GPUs themselves, so not a free attack.

### 13.3 `FRESHNESS_WINDOW` — RATIFIED

> Maximum age of an attestation nonce / issued-at timestamp
> before a proof carrying it becomes stale.

Ratified 2026-04-24: **60 seconds.**

Rationale:

- Short enough that a replayed bundle becomes invalid within one
  block-production cycle.
- Long enough that a miner on a slow residential link has time
  to fetch a challenge, compute a proof, and submit it without
  false-positive rejection.
- Symmetric around the validator nonce ring-buffer retention
  (`2 × FRESHNESS_WINDOW = 120 s`) which the spec defines for
  same-challenge double-spend protection.

### 13.4 Chain reset — RATIFIED

The original spec deferred `FORK_V2_HEIGHT` to Phase 4. The
2026-04-24 owner sign-off resolved it via the chain-reset path:
v2 launches via genesis, so `FORK_V2_HEIGHT = 0`. Justification:
the testnet has no real users, so resetting Cell balances has no
custodial impact. Pre-fork wallets are invalidated.

`FORK_V2_TC_HEIGHT` (the second fork that activates the §4 PoW
mixin) remains deferred — see §12.2.

### 13.5 Revocation

These ratifications can be revisited at any time by a new
sign-off recorded as an additional section here. Changing a
ratified parameter after Phase 2 code has shipped may require
corresponding code changes and should be coordinated with the
existing activation plan.
