# QSD Architecture: Mesh-Based Ledger (Not a Blockchain)

**Last Updated:** December 2024

---

## Is QSD a Blockchain?

**No, QSD is NOT a traditional blockchain.** It's a **mesh-based distributed ledger** that shares some characteristics with DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) but uses a unique "Dynamic Mesh" architecture.

---

## Architecture Comparison

### Traditional Blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum)

```
Block 1 → Block 2 → Block 3 → Block 4 → ...
  ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
Tx1-10    Tx11-20   Tx21-30   Tx31-40
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Linear chain** of blocks
- **Single parent** (previous block)
- **Sequential validation** (one block at a time)
- **Block-based consensus** (PoW, PoS, etc.)

### QSD: Dynamic Mesh Ledger

```
     Cell A
    /  |  \
Cell B  Cell C  Cell D
  | \    / |      |
  |  \  /  |      |
Cell E  Cell F  Cell G
```

**Characteristics:**
- **2D/3D mesh structure** (not linear)
- **Multiple parent cells** per transaction (2-5 parents)
- **Parallel validation** (multiple transactions simultaneously)
- **Proof-of-Entanglement (PoE)** consensus

## Key Differences

| Feature | Blockchain | QSD (Mesh) | DAG |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Data Structure** | Linear chain | 2D/3D Mesh | Directed Acyclic Graph |
| **Parent References** | 1 parent (previous block) | 2-5 parent cells | 1-2 parent transactions |
| **Validation** | Sequential (block-by-block) | Parallel (mesh validation) | Parallel (DAG traversal) |
| **Consensus** | PoW/PoS (block-based) | Proof-of-Entanglement | Various (Tangle, Hashgraph) |
| **Scalability** | Limited by block size/time | High (parallel processing) | High (parallel processing) |

## QSD's Mesh Architecture

### Phase 1: 2D Mesh

```
Transaction Structure:
- ID: unique identifier
- Parent Cells: [parent1, parent2]  (minimum 2 parents)
- Data: transaction payload
- Signature: ML-DSA-87 quantum-safe signature
```

**Validation:**
- Validates against **2 parent cells**
- Ensures **entanglement** (connection) with previous transactions
- Parallel validation possible

### Phase 3: 3D Mesh

```
Transaction Structure:
- ID: unique identifier
- Parent Cells: [parent1, parent2, parent3, parent4, parent5]  (3-5 parents)
- Data: transaction payload
- Signature: ML-DSA-87 quantum-safe signature
```

**Validation:**
- Validates against **3-5 parent cells**
- **3D mesh validation** with CUDA acceleration
- Enhanced security through multiple parent verification

## Proof-of-Entanglement (PoE)

**Not Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake!**

PoE validates transactions by:
1. **Checking parent cells** (2-5 previous transactions)
2. **Verifying signatures** (ML-DSA-87 quantum-safe)
3. **Ensuring mesh connectivity** (entanglement with network)
4. **Validating transaction data** (amounts, addresses, etc.)

**Key Concept:** Transactions are "entangled" with multiple previous transactions, creating a mesh network rather than a linear chain.

## Why "Mesh" Instead of "Blockchain"?

### Advantages of Mesh Architecture:

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Multiple transactions can be validated simultaneously
   - No waiting for block confirmation
   - Higher throughput potential

2. **No Block Size Limits**
   - Transactions don't need to fit in blocks
   - No block time delays
   - More flexible transaction ordering

3. **Better Scalability**
   - Can process transactions in parallel
   - No bottleneck from sequential block validation
   - Dynamic submesh routing for load distribution

4. **Quantum-Safe by Design**
   - ML-DSA-87 signatures (256-bit quantum-safe)
   - Mesh structure doesn't rely on classical cryptography assumptions
   - Future-proof against quantum attacks

## Comparison with DAGs

QSD shares similarities with DAGs (like IOTA's Tangle):

**Similarities:**
- ✅ Multiple parent references
- ✅ Parallel validation
- ✅ No blocks
- ✅ High throughput potential

**Differences:**
- 🔄 **QSD:** 2D/3D mesh with "cells" and "submeshes"
- 🔄 **DAG:** Directed graph with transactions as nodes
- 🔄 **QSD:** Proof-of-Entanglement consensus
- 🔄 **DAG:** Various consensus (Tangle, Hashgraph, etc.)
- 🔄 **QSD:** Quantum-safe cryptography (ML-DSA-87)
- 🔄 **DAG:** Typically classical cryptography

## Technical Implementation

### Transaction Structure

```go
type Transaction struct {
    ID          string
    ParentCells []string  // 2-5 parent cell IDs
    Sender      string
    Recipient   string
    Amount      float64
    Fee         float64
    Signature   []byte    // ML-DSA-87 signature
    Timestamp   time.Time
}
```

### Validation Process

1. **Receive transaction** with parent cell references
2. **Fetch parent cells** from storage
3. **Validate parent cells** (signatures, data integrity)
4. **Verify entanglement** (check parent cell connections)
5. **Validate transaction** (signature, amounts, addresses)
6. **Store transaction** in mesh

### Storage

- **SQLite database** with compressed storage
- **Indexed by:** transaction ID, parent cells, sender, recipient
- **No block structure** - transactions stored individually

## Summary

**QSD is:**
- ✅ A **mesh-based distributed ledger**
- ✅ Similar to DAGs but with unique architecture
- ✅ Uses **Proof-of-Entanglement** consensus
- ✅ **Quantum-safe** with ML-DSA-87
- ✅ **Parallel validation** capability

**QSD is NOT:**
- ❌ A traditional blockchain (no linear chain)
- ❌ Block-based (no blocks)
- ❌ Sequential validation only
- ❌ Classical cryptography only

## Why This Matters

1. **Better Scalability:** Parallel processing vs sequential blocks
2. **Quantum-Safe:** Future-proof cryptography
3. **Flexible Architecture:** Dynamic submeshes and routing
4. **No Block Delays:** Transactions validated immediately
5. **Higher Throughput:** Potential for much higher TPS than blockchains
