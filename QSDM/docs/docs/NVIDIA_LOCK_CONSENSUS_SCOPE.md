# NVIDIA-lock: HTTP, P2P, and consensus scope

This document clarifies what the current implementation enforces versus
what would require consensus or network-wide agreement. It is the
normative reference for the anti-claim language used across the trust
endpoints (`pkg/api/handlers_trust.go`) and the landing-page transparency
widget (`deploy/landing/index.html`, `deploy/landing/trust.html`).

## The one sentence that matters

> **NVIDIA-lock is an opt-in, per-operator API policy — not a consensus rule.**

Everything else on this page expands on that sentence. If this sentence
and any other sentence in QSD's documentation, code, or marketing
disagree, **this sentence wins** and the other sentence is a bug.

## What the QSD code actually does

- **HTTP API (per-node).** When the operator enables `nvidia_lock`,
  selected state-changing routes require a fresh NGC proof bundle
  before the request is admitted. Proof freshness, optional HMAC,
  ingest nonce tracking, and rate limits apply at the **local node's
  API boundary**. Neighbouring nodes are unaffected.
- **Dashboard (per-node, read-only).** Summarises NGC proof counters
  and Prometheus metrics for the operator. Scrape auth is JWT or
  `metrics_scrape_secret`.
- **Optional P2P storage policy (per-node).** When
  `nvidia_lock_gate_p2p` is set, transactions received over libp2p may
  be **rejected before local storage** if they do not carry a
  qualifying proof. This is **not** a consensus rule: other peers are
  not required to agree, and the tx may still be accepted elsewhere on
  the network.
- **Trust transparency endpoints (per-node, public, read-only).**
  Introduced in Major Update Phase 5 (§8.5). Expose aggregate counts —
  never raw attestations — under `/api/v1/trust/attestations/*`. The
  scope note that points to this document is served verbatim and also
  embedded in the landing page so third parties can independently
  observe "X of Y validators publish fresh attestations" without
  credentials. See `docs/docs/history/MAJOR_UPDATE_EXECUTED.md` §8.5.2
  for the guardrails.

## What is **not** implemented (and will not be without a hard fork)

- **Block validity / consensus.** Validators do **not** require a GPU
  attestation in block headers, transaction inclusion rules, view
  change votes, or finality signatures. PoE+BFT consensus is CPU-only
  per Major Update §1.2 and §9. A block accepted under current
  consensus rules could contain txs that would have been blocked on a
  strict API node — that's working as intended.
- **Cross-node enforcement.** There is no protocol message that proves
  "this tx was NVIDIA-lock-checked on peer X." Each operator
  configures their node independently.
- **Mining-side attestation as consensus.** Miners (post-Phase 4)
  submit PoW proofs whose `attestation` field **may** carry an NGC
  bundle. Per `MINING_PROTOCOL.md` §6 the field is a *transparency
  signal*: validators MUST NOT reject an otherwise-valid mining proof
  because the attestation is absent, stale, or missing. Acceptance is
  determined by the hash and the chain rules only.
- **NVIDIA exclusion.** Per Major Update §5.4 Stance 1, QSD is
  NVIDIA-**favored** (via kernel tuning and attestation tooling), not
  NVIDIA-exclusive. AMD, Intel, and CPU-only miners are technically
  accepted; they lose economically. The same applies to validators:
  any CPU that can keep pace with PoE+BFT runs the validator role
  without an NVIDIA GPU.

## Why this matters

The project has a standing commitment not to turn attestation posture
into a silent gating rule. Two failure modes are explicitly excluded:

1. **"Attested validators stat."** The widget renders `X of Y`,
   **never** `X` alone. A number without a denominator is an over-claim.
   The `total_public` field is always present and always ≥ `attested`.
2. **"Vendor lock-in by accident."** Any time a consensus or mining
   rule would make an NVIDIA GPU *required* rather than *favored*,
   Major Update §5.4 Stance 1 is violated. This document and
   `MINING_PROTOCOL.md` §6 jointly exist so that anyone proposing such
   a rule has a clear place to argue against.

## If consensus-level attestation were ever desired (design sketch, NOT a commitment)

A future design would need at minimum:

- a normative **proof or commitment** in the block or tx merkle
  metadata (canonical encoding mandatory),
- **validator rules** that reject blocks violating those rules,
- **fork choice** implications for a network that partly upgrades,
- and a distinct hard-fork label — this is **not** an extension of
  NVIDIA-lock; it is a separate project.

Such a design is explicitly out of scope for the Major Update and
would require its own spec, audit (analogous to
`AUDIT_PACKET_MINING.md` for Candidate C), governance vote, and
migration window. Nothing in the current codebase should be read as
foreshadowing it.
