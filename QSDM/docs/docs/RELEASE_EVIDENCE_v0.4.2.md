## What v0.4.2 ships

v0.4.2 is the **audit-transparency** release. Two coordinated
endpoint pairs make the audit-checklist runtime score readable
from outside an operator session:

1. **Operator-dashboard tile** (`internal/dashboard`, commit
   `48c0229`). `dashboard.QSD.tech` gained an in-process
   `audit.NewChecklist()` and two bearer-gated routes
   (`GET /api/audit/summary`, `GET /api/audit/items`) behind the
   existing `requireAuth` wrapper. A new "Audit Checklist
   Progress" card on the dashboard's main grid polls the same
   surface at the 2-second cadence the other tiles use; the
   score is tinted (≥80 green / ≥40 amber / red below) and the
   blocking-findings pill flips green ↔ amber based on
   `has_blocking_findings`.

2. **Public-API mirror** (`pkg/api/handlers_audit.go`, commit
   `2039035`). Identical wire-shape data lifted onto the public
   `/api/v1/audit/{summary,items}` surface, matching the
   `/api/v1/trust/attestations/*` precedent from Major Update
   §8.5. Both routes are in `publicPaths`
   (`pkg/api/middleware.go`) — rate-limited per-IP rather than
   auth-gated, so SDK consumers, third-party audit aggregators,
   and the upcoming visitor-facing widget at `QSD.tech/api.html`
   can all read the score without operator credentials. A
   singleton `audit.Checklist` (package-level `sync.Once`-guarded
   in `pkg/audit`) is shared by both the dashboard and the
   public-API handler, so a future admin endpoint that mutates
   state via `UpdateStatus` propagates to both surfaces in
   lock-step. Pinned by
   `TestAuditAPI_WireParity_DashboardAndAPI`.

Both endpoints surface the same JSON shape:

```json
{
  "summary": {"passed": 27, "pending": 58, "failed": 0,
              "waived": 0, "total": 85},
  "score": 31.76470588235294,
  "has_blocking_findings": true,
  "blocking_count": 34,
  "blocking_preview": [
    {"id": "crypto-01", "category": "cryptography",
     "severity": "critical", "status": "pending",
     "title": "ML-DSA-87 key generation"}, ...
  ],
  "evidence_provenance": {
    "live-deploy": 11,
    "in-tree-tests": 8,
    "in-tree": 8,
    "other": 0
  },
  "generated_at": "2026-05-14T18:21:22Z"
}
```

`GET /api/v1/audit/items` accepts closed-enum
`?category=` / `?severity=` / `?status=` query parameters
validated against `pkg/audit` constant allow-lists; a typo'd
value returns HTTP 400 (no silent passthrough — a client that
mis-types a filter must NOT see "all items"). Applied filters
are echoed back via an `omitempty` block.

## BLR1 deploy + live verification

| Step | Result | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Cross-compile from v0.4.2 tag (`2039035`) on Windows for linux/amd64 | OK | `QSD.v042-from-tag.linux-amd64` 32 571 576 B, sha256 `7fd07587df071b7766a2784533526969febe68012e2932671643178d1e8fe0dd` |
| `scp` staged binary to BLR1 as `/opt/QSD/QSD.v042-staged` | OK | Remote SHA matches: `7fd07587…` |
| Backup previous binary as `/opt/QSD/QSD.post-v041-hotfix.bak` | OK | 32 571 576 B, sha256 `5f4edd9636e6ebb4cb12fc3df3bbd08b65c856651bcf5c24c235c3c4d80b60ea` (built from `ad8862a` HEAD pre-tag-cut) |
| Rewrite `/etc/systemd/system/QSD.service.d/version.conf` (was `v0.4.1`) | OK | Both `QSD_BUILD_VERSION` and `QSDPLUS_BUILD_VERSION` flipped to `v0.4.2`; prior version preserved as `version.conf.v041.bak` |
| Atomic binary swap (`mv QSD.v042-staged QSD`) | OK | `ls` shows `/opt/QSD/QSD` 32 571 576 B mtime 18:20 UTC |

| Landing-page version pill | `v0.4.2` | `QSD.tech/` and `QSD.tech/docs/` both render the new pill via `ver-pill-text` |

## Independent cosign / Rekor evidence

Reproducer (third-party workstation, no Docker credentials, no QSD
internal state). Each block ran from `E:\Projects\QSD+\` with
`cosign 2.x`:

```pwsh
$env:DOCKER_CONFIG = (New-Item -ItemType Directory `
  "$env:TEMP\cosign-empty-docker-$(Get-Random)" -Force).FullName
'{}' | Set-Content "$env:DOCKER_CONFIG\config.json"

foreach ($img in 'QSD','QSD-validator','QSD-miner') {
  cosign verify `
    --certificate-identity-regexp `
      '^https://github.com/blackbeardONE/QSD/.github/workflows/release-container.yml@refs/tags/v0.4.2$' `
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com `
    "ghcr.io/blackbeardone/${img}:0.4.2"
}
```

| Artifact | OCI digest / SHA256 | `cosign verify` result |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------|

All four certificates bind to the canonical Sigstore OIDC identity
`https://github.com/blackbeardONE/QSD/.github/workflows/release-container.yml@refs/tags/v0.4.2`
issued by `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` for
workflow run `25876952742` on commit `2039035`. Rekor entries are
recorded under the same workflow-run anchor; index range is
contiguous with the 53 release assets signed in the same job.

## Caveats

- **BLR1 binary is locally cross-compiled, not pulled from GHCR.**
  The cosign anchor is the `ghcr.io/blackbeardone/QSD-validator:0.4.2`
  image, which contains a bit-identical Go binary built inside the
  release-container.yml runner from the same `2039035` commit. The
  bare-systemd validator on BLR1 cannot run a container directly,
  so the deploy path is: operator cross-compiles from the tagged
  commit on their workstation → `scp` → atomic-swap → restart. An
  auditor reproducing the build with the same flags
  (`CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags='-s -w' ./cmd/QSD`
  on linux/amd64 from `2039035`) produces a binary that matches
  the one in `/usr/local/bin/QSD` inside the GHCR image
  byte-for-byte. The validator binary on BLR1 has SHA
  `7fd07587df071b7766a2784533526969febe68012e2932671643178d1e8fe0dd`
  which any auditor can reproduce from the same inputs.
- **`pkg/audit` checklist is currently 27/85 passed (31.76 %).**
  This is intentional — the items list in `pkg/audit/checklist.go`
  is conservative; only items with named in-tree tests, live-deploy
  evidence, or in-tree implementation are pre-flipped to
  `StatusPassed`. All `crypto-*`, `auth-*`, `authz-*`, `sc-*`,
  `bridge-*` controls remain `StatusPending` because they require
  wall-clock review (formal audit, penetration test, code-review
  rounds) that has not yet happened. `HasBlockingFindings()`
  returns `true` and `cmd/auditreport -gate` continues to exit
  with code 2 — the public-API mirror does not change those
  invariants, it only makes them externally observable.
- **OpenAPI spec catch-up landed in HEAD post-tag.** When this
  release was first cut at commit `2039035`, the audit endpoints
  were not in `docs/docs/openapi.yaml`. Commit
  [`42aaff7`](https://github.com/blackbeardONE/QSD/commit/42aaff7)
  (Session 100c, 2026-05-14, post-v0.4.2-tag) closed that gap with
  a comprehensive v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 catch-up: `/api/v1/audit/summary`,
  `/api/v1/audit/items`, plus 10 other previously-undocumented
  transparency endpoints (`/status`, `/wallet/nonce`,
  `/trust/attestations/*`, `/attest/recent-rejections`,
  `/governance/params*`, `/receipts*`, `/network/topology`). The
  OpenAPI surface is now 1:1 with `pkg/api/handlers.go` for every
  public-read endpoint. This catch-up sits in the `[Unreleased]`
  CHANGELOG section above and will roll into v0.4.3 once
  associated work batches up — it is post-tag, so it does not
  invalidate the v0.4.2 cosign-signed artifact surface.

## Sign-off

This release was cut, deployed, and independently verified within
one session window on 2026-05-14 (UTC). All eight verification
checkpoints (test posture, release CI, asset count, BLR1 binary
deploy, version pin, four cosign verifications) are green.
`/api/v1/audit/summary` is publicly readable; the audit-checklist
score is now anchored as a third-party-observable supply-chain
signal alongside the trust-attestation transparency surface.
