# QSD Web Wallet — Self-Custody Reference

Public URL: <https://QSD.tech/wallet/>
Source:    `QSD/source/wasm_modules/wallet/cmd/QSD-wallet/main.go`
            `QSD/deploy/landing/wallet.html`
            `QSD/deploy/landing/wallet.js`
Sibling:   `QSDcli wallet new|show|inspect|sign` (CLI · same keystore format)

The web wallet is a static page that generates and operates ML-DSA-87
(FIPS 204) wallets entirely client-side. The QSD validators play no
role in keystore creation or storage; the only network traffic from
`/wallet/` is the GET of `wallet.html`, `wasm_exec.js`, `wallet.wasm`,
and `wallet.js`.

This document is the reference for what the page does, how, and why.

**Why split the crypto?** Each side is doing what it is designed for:

- **WebCrypto** is a battle-tested browser primitive for password-based
  symmetric encryption. Using it instead of a WASM-side PBKDF2/AES
  saves ~500 KB of WASM, eliminates a side-channel surface, and matches
  the OWASP guidance to use the platform's native primitives when
  available.
- **WASM** is the only practical way to ship a FIPS-204 ML-DSA-87
  signer in a browser. WebCrypto does not expose post-quantum
  signature schemes (as of late 2026), so Go-compiled-to-WASM is the
  reference path. The same `cloudflare/circl` ML-DSA-87 implementation
  is what the validator side uses, so the browser cannot accidentally
  produce a signature the network refuses.

---

## 2. Keystore JSON format (v1)

Defined by `pkg/keystore` in the Go source tree. Both the CLI and the
browser emit byte-identical files:

```json
{
  "version":      1,
  "type":         "QSD-keystore",
  "algorithm":    "ml-dsa-87",
  "address":      "<hex sha256(public_key)>",
  "public_key":   "<hex 2592-byte FIPS 204 ML-DSA-87 public key>",
  "kdf":          "pbkdf2-sha256",
  "kdf_params":   { "iterations": 600000, "salt": "<hex 16>", "key_len": 32 },
  "cipher":       "aes-256-gcm",
  "cipher_params":{ "nonce": "<hex 12>" },
  "ciphertext":   "<hex AES-256-GCM(private_key) with appended 16-byte tag>",
  "created_at":   "RFC 3339 UTC"
}
```

Cross-compatibility is enforced by `QSD/source/pkg/keystore/keystore_test.go`
plus an offline Node.js test that decrypts a CLI-produced keystore using
WebCrypto and signs via WASM (`_tmp_xcompat.js` in the repo root —
`.gitignored`; runnable manually).

Bumping `iterations` is forward-compatible (a future build can produce
700 k-iter keystores and the Go-side `Validate` only complains if the
value is below 100 000). Lowering iterations would be a regression and
is enforced against.

## 3. Threat model

What the wallet **does** protect against:

1. **Server-side custody risk.** No QSD operator, validator, or
   third-party service ever holds the private key. The validator's
   `POST /api/v1/wallet/create` endpoint is intentionally **not** used by
   this page — that route returns a "ghost" address with no recoverable
   key, useful only as a write-only sink. The web wallet replaces it.
2. **Network observers** (passive and active). The page never POSTs the
   passphrase, the private key, or even the public address. Confirm in
   DevTools → Network: the only requests are the four static GETs above.
3. **Disk-resident attackers (offline).** The keystore on disk is
   AES-256-GCM-encrypted under a PBKDF2-derived key (600 k iterations,
   SHA-256). At commodity hardware speeds (~10⁵ guesses/sec on a
   single GPU), a 12-character alphanumeric passphrase has ~10²¹
   combinations — comfortably out of reach. A 6-character passphrase is
   trivially crackable; the page warns at 8 characters but does not
   refuse (only a zero-byte passphrase is rejected outright).
4. **Tampered keystore JSON.** The Go-side `keystore.Validate` enforces
   that `sha256(public_key) == address`; the browser-side equivalent
   (`validateKeystore` in `wallet.js`) does the same check before
   prompting for a passphrase. A flipped byte in the ciphertext fails the
   AES-GCM tag verification at decrypt time.

What the wallet **does NOT** protect against (and explicit warnings in
the UI call this out):

5. **A compromised QSD web server.** If an attacker replaces
   `wallet.wasm` or `wallet.js` on the QSD.tech CDN, the page can be
   modified to exfiltrate the private key the moment it's generated.
   Mitigations:
   - The repo publishes the WASM artefact at a known path with a
     git-tracked SHA-256 (see `RELEASE_NOTES`).
   - The CLI (`QSDcli wallet new`) is the cold-storage path that
     bypasses the website entirely.
   - Subresource Integrity (SRI) for `wallet.wasm` is a planned
     follow-up; the WebAssembly fetch needs the hash baked into the
     HTML for that to be useful, so it requires a deploy-time
     rewrite step.
6. **A compromised endpoint** (your laptop's browser, OS, or
   keyboard logger). The wallet runs in-tab; if the OS is compromised,
   nothing here helps.
7. **A weak passphrase.** PBKDF2-600 k is OWASP-compliant but
   purely a delay against offline guessing — a passphrase like
   `password123` is still cracked in seconds. Pick a passphrase
   long enough that brute-force is infeasible.

## 4. Verifying the build (deployer checklist)

A QSD operator (you, on `blackbeardONE/QSD`) ships the wallet by:

1. Running `./QSD/scripts/build_wallet_wasm.sh`. Output:
   - `QSD/deploy/landing/wallet.wasm` (~3 MB)
   - `QSD/deploy/landing/wasm_exec.js` (copied from `$GOROOT/lib/wasm/`)
2. Committing both files to the repo. The SHA-256 of `wallet.wasm` is
   reproducible from the same Go toolchain version + `go.sum`-pinned
   `cloudflare/circl` version, so two independent builds agree byte-for-byte
   (modulo `-trimpath`-suppressed file paths).
3. Verifying locally:
   - `python3 -m http.server -d QSD/deploy/landing 8088`
   - Open `http://127.0.0.1:8088/wallet.html`
   - Confirm DevTools → Network shows GETs only for the four static files
     and nothing else after pressing Generate.
4. Confirming the published build matches the repo:
   - `curl -s https://QSD.tech/wallet.wasm | sha256sum`
   - Compare to the value in `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.x.md` under "wallet WASM SHA-256".

## 5. Practical recipes

### 5a. Generate an address for Hive or the console miner

```bash
# CLI path — quietest, scriptable
./QSDcli wallet new --passphrase-file ./pass.txt --out ~/.QSD/wallet.json
ADDR="$(./QSDcli wallet show --in ~/.QSD/wallet.json | awk '/^address/{print $2}')"

# Consumer path: import the keystore JSON in QSD Hive and run eligible tasks.
# Advanced/operator path: use QSDminer-console with a v2 NVIDIA enrollment.
./QSDminer-console --protocol=v2 --validator=https://api.QSD.tech --address="$ADDR"
```

### 5b. Read an address out of a keystore without revealing the private key

```bash
./QSDcli wallet show --in ~/.QSD/wallet.json
# Address + public-key fields are plaintext in the keystore JSON.
# The private key remains AES-256-GCM-encrypted; no passphrase prompted.
```

### 5c. Verify keystore integrity end-to-end

```bash
./QSDcli wallet inspect --in ~/.QSD/wallet.json --passphrase-file ./pass.txt
# Decrypts, then reconstructs the public key from the recovered private key
# and compares against the stored public_key. Fails loudly if the keystore
# was edited after encryption.
```

### 5d. Sign an arbitrary message (e.g., a transaction envelope)

```bash
echo -n '{"sender":"0xabc","amount":100}' \
  | ./QSDcli wallet sign --in ~/.QSD/wallet.json --passphrase-file ./pass.txt --message-file -
# Stdout: hex ML-DSA-87 signature (4627 bytes).
```

Browser equivalent: the **Sign message** tab on `QSD.tech/wallet/` does
exactly the same thing for short UTF-8 messages.

## 6. Sky Fang wallet-link automation

Sky Fang's QSD integration uses a link challenge minted inside the game:

```text
QSD-LINK:<short-code>:<nonce>
```

The player-facing flow is the QSD Hive deep-link path. Manual public-key and
signature copy-paste is no longer the normal path:

```text
QSD-hive://skyfang-link?challenge_url=<url>&submit_url=<url>&return_url=<url>
```

Current player flow:

1. Player opens `https://skyfang.xyz/dashboard/QSD` and signs in to Sky Fang.
2. Player clicks **Confirm with QSD Hive** on the Windows PC that has Hive
   installed. Hive signs the Sky Fang challenge locally and posts
   `{code, public_key, signature}` back to Sky Fang.

The Android game can open the same Sky Fang page for status and handoff, but
the wallet signature still happens in QSD Hive on Windows because that is
where the QSD keystore lives. The flow stays on `skyfang.xyz`; the
`QSD.tech/wallet` page is no longer part of the normal player path.
The legacy mobile entry point `https://skyfang.xyz/link-wallet` is kept as a
compatibility redirect to `https://skyfang.xyz/dashboard/QSD`.

The in-game `/QSDlink` command remains a shortcut that shows a short-lived
Sky Fang confirmation URL:

```text
https://skyfang.xyz/api/QSD/link-confirm?code=<short-code>
```

That page also shows **Confirm with QSD Hive** and opens the
`QSD-hive://skyfang-link...` deep link.

Why this is the best quick path:

- QSD Hive registers the `QSD-hive://` protocol.
- `QSDcli wallet sign` already signs arbitrary messages with ML-DSA-87.
- The private key stays in the local wallet/keystore; Sky Fang never sees it.
- No Chrome Web Store review, no extension key custody, and no new browser
  security model for v1.

A browser extension can still be a phase-2 product, but it is more work:

- It needs a secure extension keystore and unlock UX.
- It needs ML-DSA-87 signing in WASM inside the extension.
- It must mediate origin permissions for `skyfang.xyz` and `QSD.tech`.
- It requires packaging/signing/review and ongoing update management.

The wallet page's manual Sign tab is a developer/emergency diagnostic fallback
only. For players, install QSD Hive and use the one-click Sky Fang confirmation
page.

## 7. Known limitations / roadmap

- The wallet page does not currently broadcast signed transactions; it
  produces the signature and leaves transport to the operator (curl,
  QSDcli tx, SDK). A "send transaction" tab is planned for v0.4.0
  once the v2 mining payload format settles.
- WebCrypto's PBKDF2 implementation is constant-iteration; on slower
  hardware (mobile browsers) the encrypt step can take 2-3 seconds.
  The page spinners through it but the UX is not great. Argon2
  (faster + memory-hard) would be the upgrade path — it isn't in
  WebCrypto as of late 2026, so this would require a WASM-side
  KDF, which is itself an attack surface. Holding for upstream.
- No keystore "rename / move passphrase" flow yet. Implementable: open,
  re-encrypt with a new passphrase, save. Trivial follow-up.
- No browser-side mnemonic seed phrase. ML-DSA-87 keys do not have a
  deterministic / BIP-39 representation in the way Ed25519 keys do;
  encoding 4896 bytes of secret material into a wordlist would
  produce an unwieldy ~480-word phrase. The encrypted JSON keystore is
  the recovery artefact instead.
