#
# Guardrail against re-introducing the retired Prometheus metric-name
# prefix `QSDplus_*` (Major Update §6, "QSDplus -> QSD" rebrand,
# completed in commit db9b590).
#
# The dual-emit window closed with the rebrand: `pkg/monitoring/
# prometheus_prefix_migration.go` was deleted, every canonical metric
# now uses the `QSD_*` prefix only, and no `QSDplus_*` literals remain
# in the source tree. This script's job is to keep it that way -- a
# new file containing a `QSDplus_<subsystem>_<suffix>` literal is
# almost certainly a regression, either a stale rebase from a
# pre-rebrand branch or a paste from an outdated runbook.
#
# Hand-written `QSD_*` literals are EXPECTED and not flagged: the
# canonical prefix is the only prefix we publish today.
#
# Scope:
#   1) Match only Prometheus-style metric-name literals (suffixed with
#      `_total` / `_seconds` / `_bucket` etc.) to avoid tripping on
#      branding aliases like `QSDplus_node_id` historically present
#      in NGC proof JSON field names (no metric suffix).
#   2) Two passes:
#        (a) Go sources under QSD/source/ (includes *.go AND *_test.go
#            because the `*.go` glob matches both; test files are NOT
#            excluded).
#        (b) Non-Go text assets anywhere in the tree: *.md, *.yml,
#            *.yaml, *.json, *.js -- the shapes that ship to operators
#            (alert rules, Grafana dashboards, runbooks, SDK tests).
#      Binary artefacts, temp files, and node_modules/dist directories
#      are skipped.
#
# Exits 0 if every legacy metric reference is in the allowlist below,
# 1 otherwise.

# Files that are explicitly allowed to contain `QSDplus_*` metric
# names. With the rebrand complete, no in-tree files actually need
# this exemption today (every Go source / dashboard / alert rule
# uses the canonical `QSD_*` prefix). The allowlist is preserved as
# documentation: if a future migration ever needs to re-emit the
# retired prefix from a specific test or operator runbook, this is
# where it goes.
