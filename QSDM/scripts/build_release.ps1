# build_release.ps1 — produce signed-ready console miner releases.
#
# Builds QSDminer for the supported (os, arch) tuples and writes the
# artifacts plus a SHA256SUMS.txt under release/. Run from the repo
# root or anywhere — the script resolves QSD/source/ relative to its
# own location, so `pwsh QSD/scripts/build_release.ps1` from any cwd
# does the right thing.
#
# The output binary is named `QSDminer` (not `QSDminer-console`) to
# keep the operator-facing command short. The Go module command we
# build is still cmd/QSDminer-console — that's the canonical source
# for the console miner with the wizard, live panel, --idle-only, and
# --service mode wired in. cmd/QSDminer (no suffix) stays in tree as
# the audit-only minimal reference miner.
#
# What the release directory looks like after a run:
#
#   release/
#     v0.0.0+a1b2c3d/
#       QSDminer-windows-amd64.exe
#       QSDminer-linux-amd64
#       QSDminer-linux-arm64
#       QSDminer-darwin-arm64
#       QSDminer-darwin-amd64
#       SHA256SUMS.txt
#       MANIFEST.json
#
# Operators publish the directory as-is at https://QSD.tech/releases/<tag>/
# (see deploy/landing/download.html which fetches MANIFEST.json to populate
# the platform-detected download buttons).
#
# Flags:
#   -Tag <string>     Override the version tag (default: pkg/buildinfo
#                     resolution from git: <BuildVersion>+<short SHA>).
#   -Platforms <list> Comma-separated list of "os/arch" tuples to limit
#                     the build (default: all supported tuples).
#   -SkipCli          Don't ship QSDcli alongside QSDminer.
#   -SkipAttester     Don't ship QSD-attester (the home-3050 issuer).
