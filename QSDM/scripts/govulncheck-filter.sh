# =====================
# Run govulncheck v1.6.0 in JSON mode from the current working directory,
# then exit:
#   0 if every reported OSV id is in the allowlist below,
#   0 if no OSVs were reported at all,
#   1 if any OSV is reported that is NOT in the allowlist (NEW vuln
#     surfaced -- that is what we actually want to break CI on).
#
# Scanner diagnostics and affected-finding summaries are always printed so
# humans can see the classification in the job log even when the gate passes.
#
# Allowlist posture: intentionally empty. GO-2024-3218 used to be tracked
# here while QSD used go-libp2p-kad-dht for WAN discovery. That DHT path was
# removed in favor of explicit bootstrap-peer dialing, so any reachable
# govulncheck finding should now fail this gate.
#
# Every entry below MUST carry a tracking comment with:
#   - the OSV id
#   - a short reason (upstream unpatched / false positive / etc.)
#   - either "expires=YYYY-MM-DD" or a linked tracking issue, so the
#     allowlist doesn't silently rot forever.

# Important: govulncheck's -json mode emits TWO kinds of records that
# carry an OSV id:
#
#   1. {"osv": {"id": "GO-...", ...}}     -- a raw advisory database
#      entry. govulncheck streams the entire catalog that matched by
#      MODULE VERSION. Most of these are NOT reachable from our call
#      graph. Filtering on this field alone yields 100+ false positives.
#
#   2. {"finding": {"osv": "GO-...", ...}} -- a module, package, or
#      symbol finding. A module-only notice has a one-frame trace containing
#      module/version but no package. Package and symbol findings include a
#      package path and demonstrate that affected code enters QSD's build.
#
# Only package/symbol records from (2) should gate CI. The earlier versions
# keyed off either (1) or any non-empty trace; the latter incorrectly counted
# module-only notices emitted by newer scanners.
