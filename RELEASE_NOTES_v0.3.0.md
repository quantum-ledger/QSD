# QSD v0.3.0 — Release Notes

> **Scope.** This document captures the state of the repository at the v0.3.0 cut. It is the tracked, source-of-truth counterpart to the operator-local `NEXT_STEPS.md` (which is `.gitignore`d by design). The release is in-repo complete; the items in *Remaining external blockers* gate any actual public publish or mainnet announcement.

## At a glance

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Target tag (Go core) | `v0.4.0` — **pushed** (`https://github.com/quantum-ledger/QSD/releases/tag/v0.4.0`). Predecessors: `v0.3.0` (foundation), `v0.3.1`, `v0.3.2` (v1 deprecation), `v0.3.3` (sessions 89-91 durability + mint deprecation, 2026-05-12), `v0.4.0` (sessions 95-97 self-custody Send transaction backend + browser tab + WASM signing, 2026-05-13). |

## Headline changes since the previous release line

### v0.3.0 surface (sessions 70–74)

- **Quantum-secure crypto path**: ML-DSA-87 (NIST FIPS 204) is the production signature scheme. The pure-Go fallback is gated by `QSD_NO_CGO=1`; the CGO path uses liboqs and is the default on Linux/macOS/Windows once `QSD/liboqs_install` exists.
- **Two-tier node model**: validator (CPU-only, PoE + BFT) and miner (Mesh3D-tied PoW) split into separate Docker images, K8s manifests, and binary `cmd/QSD` + `cmd/QSDminer`.
- **Cell tokenomics live**: emission schedule, 4-year halvings, 10-second target block time, treasury allocation. Exposed via `/api/v1/status`, the SDK, and the dashboard tokenomics panel.
- **Mining sub-protocol shipped**: `MINING_PROTOCOL.md`, `pkg/mining`, `cmd/QSDminer`, reference CPU miner solves proofs that the verifier accepts. CUDA fat-binary kernel covers `sm_50` through `sm_90`.
- **Trust & attestation page**: `/api/v1/trust/attestations/*`, dashboard widget, anti-claim landing widget.
- **JavaScript SDK at parity with the Go SDK**: 17 `node:test` cases, full method coverage, ESM/CJS exports, `prepublishOnly` test gate, Sigstore provenance.
- **Soak harnesses validated at length** (this session): mempool 10 min / 19.1 M txs / 31.9 K tx/sec; pubsub 10 min / 4 hosts / 239 987 publishes / per-host receive spread of 6 messages over 600 s.
- **Supply-chain hardening**: source SBOM (SPDX 2.3) and image SBOMs via `anchore/sbom-action`; cosign keyless signing of every binary, every container image, and `SHA256SUMS`; OIDC-driven, no operator key custody.
- **CVE remediation (session 73)**: Go directive `1.25.9 → 1.25.10`, `golang.org/x/net` `v0.52.0 → v0.53.0` closed three reachable CVEs (`GO-2026-4976`, `GO-2026-4971`, `GO-2026-4918`). One unpatched finding (`GO-2024-3218`) is tracked as audit entry `supply-08` with a written mitigation rationale.

### Session 74 (verification cut)

This is a verification-only session — no code changes, only confirmation that the prior session is reproducible and release-ready.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `git status --porcelain` at HEAD `de2bf30` | clean (0 files) |
| `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 900s` (full, non-`-short`) | 67 / 67 packages OK |
| `go vet ./...` | clean |
| `go vet -tags soak ./tests/...` | clean |
| `go mod verify` | all modules verified |
| `govulncheck ./...` | 1 finding (`GO-2024-3218`, tracked as `supply-08`) |
| `node --test sdk/javascript/QSD.test.js` | 17 / 17 pass in 11.34 s |
| `npm pack --dry-run` (sdk/javascript/) | `QSD-0.3.0.tgz`, 6 files, 6.3 kB packed (LICENSE + CHANGELOG.md present) |
| 8 release binaries `-trimpath -ldflags="-s -w"` build | all clean; `--version` banner stamps `go1.25.10` |
| **10-min pubsub soak** (4 hosts × 2 producers × 50 Hz × 256 B) | **PASS in 601.99 s**: 239 987 publishes; 719 946 cross-host receipts; per-host receive totals `[179 985 / 179 987 / 179 984 / 179 990]` (total spread = 6 messages across 4 hosts over 600 s); no partition; no sustained-error window; flat rate throughout |

## Sessions 75–80: release pipeline shakedown + third-party verification

The first push of `v0.3.0` on `9c6bdde` (session 74) created an empty release skeleton with 0 assets — the workflow failed at four distinct latent bugs that had never run in production because no prior tag had exercised this path end-to-end. Four follow-up fix commits and one verification session resolved them:

| Session | Commit | Layer fixed | Root cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| 75 | `134abf1` | `QSD-go.yml` red-since-session-72 | `ubuntu-latest` runners ship no `ripgrep`; the two rebrand-guardrail scripts (`check-no-new-legacy-metrics.sh`, `check-no-collapsed-env-preferred.sh`) call `rg` and exited 2. Fix: `apt-get install ripgrep` in the build-test job. |
| 76 | `d8326c6` | `gh release upload` duplicate-glob | `QSDminer-*` and `*.sig` both matched `QSDminer-*.sig`; gh tried to upload the same name twice and the API rejected the second attempt (`HTTP 422 ReleaseAsset.name already exists`). `--clobber` only handles the *existing* release, not earlier duplicates inside the same call. Fix: collapse to a single `./*` glob (the asset dir contains only release artefacts at that point). |
| 77 | `83c1128` | **The actual root cause of every SBOM failure** | GHCR is case-sensitive. `docker/metadata-action@v5` auto-lowercases the namespace per OCI convention so `docker/build-push-action` pushes to `ghcr.io/quantum-ledger/<image>`. Every downstream step that constructed an image reference from `${{ github.repository_owner }}` raw used the mixed-case `quantum-ledger` and got "manifest unknown". Sessions 75 and 76 chased the symptoms (`registry-username` / `registry-password`, `docker pull`) — none of those addressed the actual case mismatch. Fix: a single `imgbase` step per image job that computes the lowercased ref once and feeds it to `docker/metadata-action`, the `docker pull` step, the `anchore/sbom-action`, and the `cosign attest` step. |
| 78 | `c00fccd` | bash `for tag in <newlines>` | `${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}` is newline-separated. The bash construct `for tag in ${{ … }}; do …` produces a multi-line `for` header that bash rejects (`syntax error near unexpected token 'ghcr.io/.../...:0.3'`). This bug had always been present but was shielded by earlier failing steps in sessions 75–77. Fix: pass `TAGS` through the env block and pipe `printf '%s\n' "$TAGS" | while read`. |

`release-container.yml` run `25650171771` on `c00fccd` finally produced a 10-of-10 green release pipeline:

| Job | Result |
|---|---|
| `binaries (linux/amd64)` | success |
| `binaries (linux/arm64)` | success |
| `binaries (darwin/amd64)` | success |
| `binaries (darwin/arm64)` | success |
| `binaries (windows/amd64)` | success |
| `source SBOM (SPDX)` | success |
| `ghcr QSD (legacy image name)` | success — image + signature + SBOM attestation |
| `ghcr QSD-validator (CPU-only)` | success — image + signature + SBOM attestation |
| `ghcr QSD-miner (GPU miner runtime)` | success — image + signature + SBOM attestation |
| `attach binaries + SBOM + signatures to release` | success — 66 assets uploaded |

Plus two GitHub-side cleanups via the REST API: deleted two orphaned **draft** releases (ids `320195790` and `320254619`) that survived earlier tag deletions because GitHub keeps the release object as an orphan draft when its tag is removed.

### Session 79 — independent third-party verification

After publishing, an independent verifier on a Windows 11 / Go 1.24.2 / cosign v2.4.1 host (no Docker installed) downloaded the live release and reproduced the supply-chain claims end-to-end. Full procedure and expected output: [`QSD/docs/docs/V030_POST_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md`](QSD/docs/docs/V030_POST_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md). Headline:

| Verification | Result |
|---|---|
| `QSDminer-windows-amd64.exe --version` (native) | `QSDminer v0.3.0 (c00fccd, 2026-05-11T04:23:54Z, go1.25.10, windows/amd64)` |
| SHA256 cross-match of 6 representative downloads against `SHA256SUMS` | 6 / 6 byte-exact |
| `cosign verify-blob` against 7 keyless-signed blobs (5 binaries + `SHA256SUMS` + source SBOM) | 7 / 7 `Verified OK` |
| `cosign verify` against 3 GHCR images (anonymous, `DOCKER_CONFIG=empty`) | 3 / 3 success — every certificate pins `githubWorkflowSha=c00fccd93a66c5317aaaa03b80e9a09d111e87bd`, `githubWorkflowRef=refs/tags/v0.3.0` |
| `cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson` against 3 image SBOMs | 3 / 3 success |
| Sigstore identity bound by every signing certificate | `https://github.com/quantum-ledger/QSD/.github/workflows/release-container.yml@refs/tags/v0.3.0` (issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`) |
| `QSD:0.3.0` image manifest digest | `sha256:3f46260eef8a702c2e45631824cab8f59f2f792bb2efcb952d0de514509dad1e` |

### Session 80 — post-release maintenance pass

After v0.3.0 shipped, two repo-state issues remained from the long debug period:

- **`macos-build.yml` queue was clogged.** 11 runs (sessions 73 onward, plus 6 dependabot PR runs) had been sitting in `queued` for up to 14 hours because the hosted macOS pool can only execute ~2 runners at a time and `concurrency.cancel-in-progress` only cancels runs in the *same* `head_ref` group. Cancelled 10 stale entries via `POST /actions/runs/{id}/cancel`, kept the latest v0.3.0 push run.
- **Hidden no-CGO bug in `build_macos.sh`.** Once the queue cleared and a fresh `macos-build` run on `ae88fdc` finally got a macOS runner, the no-CGO job failed immediately:
  ```
  go: cannot find main module, but found .git/config in /Users/runner/work/QSD/QSD
  ```
  Root cause: the no-CGO branch of `build_macos.sh` (`QSD_NO_CGO=1`) ran `go build ./cmd/QSD` from the QSD repo root, but `go.mod` lives at `QSD/source/go.mod`. The CGO branch (lines 98–107) already handled the `source/` indirection via an `if [[ -f source/go.mod ]]; then cd source` guard; the no-CGO branch (line 34) did not. This bug had been latent forever — the macOS workflow had never actually finished a run end-to-end because the runner queue was always backlogged. Fix: mirror the same `source/`-detection guard into the no-CGO branch.
- **Hidden smoke-check hang in `macos-build.yml`.** After the no-CGO build succeeded, the next step ran `./QSD --version || ./QSD version || true`, but `cmd/QSD` is the **validator** binary — it does not implement `--version`; unknown flags are ignored and the binary launches a full validator node (DHT bootstrap, libp2p relay, pubsub, dashboard server). The smoke check therefore never returned, and the job sat consuming a runner until `timeout-minutes: 15` cancelled it. Fix: wrap each invocation in `timeout 5`. The exit code is irrelevant (the `|| true` chain absorbs any failure); we only need the binary's process to release the runner.
- **Hidden CGO `universal2` cross-compile bug in `rebuild_liboqs_macos.sh`.** With the no-CGO fix in place, the CGO macos-14 job exposed the next latent bug:
  ```
  error: unknown target CPU 'armv8-a+crypto'
  note: valid target CPU values are: nocona, core2, ... x86-64-v4
  ```
  Root cause: the script defaulted to `QSD_LIBOQS_ARCH=universal2`, which sets `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"`. liboqs's cmake auto-detection runs once and picks `-march=armv8-a+crypto` from the arm64 slice's feature probe, then applies it globally — including to the x86_64 slice's compile, which rejects `armv8-a+crypto` as an unknown target CPU. CI builds each arch separately in a matrix anyway, so universal2 is wasted work. Fix: default `QSD_LIBOQS_ARCH` to `$(uname -m)` (arm64 on macos-14, x86_64 on macos-13). Operators distributing a single fat dylib can still opt in with `QSD_LIBOQS_ARCH=universal2`.
- **Dependabot triage.** 10 open PRs (most pre-dating the session 75 `ripgrep` fix in `QSD-go.yml`, so their `build-test` runs failed for an unrelated reason). Merged the two clean pure-Go bumps with full green CI:
  - `#11`: `github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub` `0.15.0` → `0.16.0`
  - `#12`: `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` `1.14.28` → `1.14.44` (merged after rebase onto `ae88fdc`)
  Posted `@dependabot rebase` on the remaining six (`#1`, `#5`, `#6`, `#7`, `#8`, `#10`) so they pick up the ripgrep fix on their next CI run.
- **Deferred to next release cycle.** Two PRs are green at the QSD-go layer but their PR CI does *not* exercise `release-container.yml` (which runs only on `push: tags: v*`). Merging them risks re-breaking the release pipeline we just stabilised in sessions 75–78:
  - `#2`: `docker/login-action` `3` → `4`
  - `#13`: `docker/build-push-action` `6` → `7`
  Path forward: cut a `v0.3.1-rc1` tag against a temporary branch carrying both bumps, watch `release-container.yml` complete end-to-end (especially the cosign attest + SBOM upload steps), then merge if all 10 jobs are green.

### Session 81 — npm publish attempt + package rename

Pushed tag `sdk-js-v0.3.0` against commit `c00fccd9`, supplied an `NPM_TOKEN`
with 2FA bypass, and re-ran `sdk-javascript-publish.yml`. The workflow ran
all tests, packed the tarball, signed the build with the GitHub-Actions OIDC
identity, and published the provenance attestation to Sigstore Rekor at
**logIndex `1506312160`** — and then the registry rejected the actual
`PUT /QSD` with:

```
403 Forbidden — Package name too similar to existing packages
qs, esm, jsdom, tsm, tsd, tsdx; try renaming your package to
'@anachronoa/QSD' and publishing with 'npm publish --access=public' instead.
```

This is npm's typo-squatting heuristic applied to new package names; it is
not appealable through CI. Two paths forward: (a) scoped name
`@<scope>/QSD`, (b) unscoped name with a suffix. Chose **(b) `QSD-sdk`**:
matches the `aws-sdk` / `stripe-sdk` convention, preserves the QSD brand,
and avoids tying the public package id to any individual's npm username.

Rename touched only user-visible surface:

- `QSD/source/sdk/javascript/package.json`: `"name": "QSD"` → `"QSD-sdk"`.
- `QSD/source/sdk/javascript/README.md`: install line and `require()` example.
- `QSD/source/sdk/javascript/QSD.js`: JSDoc snippet.
- `QSD/source/sdk/javascript/CHANGELOG.md`: explicit rename entry under 0.3.0.
- `.github/workflows/sdk-javascript-publish.yml`: header comment + job name.

Nothing else changes: the GitHub repo is still `quantum-ledger/QSD`, the
binaries are still `QSD` / `QSDminer-gui` / `QSDminer` / `trustcheck` /
`genesis-ceremony`, the import-time class is still `QSDClient`, the
on-chain brand and the GHCR images are still `QSD:0.3.0`. Only the npm
package id picks up the `-sdk` suffix.

The failed `sdk-js-v0.3.0` attempt's provenance is permanently archived on
Rekor (`logIndex=1506312160`) — that record links the GitHub Actions run
that produced it to the `QSD-0.3.0.tgz` tarball SHA, even though npm never
accepted the upload. After the rename publish succeeds, the registry copy
will carry a fresh provenance entry for the `QSD-sdk` name.

### Session 82 — self-custody wallet (CLI + browser, byte-compatible)

Closed the largest remaining product hole at v0.3.0: there was no
operator-facing way to obtain a QSD address whose private key the
operator actually controlled. The existing `POST /api/v1/wallet/create`
handler generates an ML-DSA-87 keypair and *discards* the private key
when the request scope exits — fine as a write-only mining sink, useless
for self-custody.

**Shipped in this session:**

- **`pkg/keystore`** (new package): canonical JSON-on-disk keystore
  format. PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 (600 000 iterations, OWASP 2023) → AES-256-GCM
  (12-byte nonce, 16-byte tag). `Validate` enforces algorithm + version +
  KDF-floor + `sha256(public_key) == address` cross-check. 13 unit tests
  cover round-trip, wrong-passphrase, schema-shape, tamper detection,
  weak-KDF rejection, and the empty-passphrase refusal.
- **`QSDcli wallet new|show|inspect|sign`** (new subcommand): builds a
  fresh ML-DSA-87 keypair locally, encrypts the private key under a
  passphrase (prompted with `golang.org/x/term`, no echo, or supplied
  via `--passphrase-file`), writes the keystore as mode-0600. `new`
  prints **only** the address to stdout so it pipes straight into
  `QSDminer --address=$(QSDcli wallet new …)`. `inspect` decrypts
  and verifies the decrypted private key produces the stored public key
  (round-trip integrity check). `sign` produces a 4627-byte ML-DSA-87
  signature over an arbitrary message.
- **Browser wallet at `https://QSD.tech/wallet/`** (new page +
  WASM module):
  - `wasm_modules/wallet/cmd/QSD-wallet/main.go` — Go→WebAssembly entry
    point, ~3.1 MB. Exposes `QSD_wallet_generate / sign / verify /
    address_from_public_key / version` to JavaScript via `js.FuncOf`.
  - `deploy/landing/wallet.html` — 3-tab UI (Generate / Open / Sign),
    matching the existing landing-page design language and nav.
  - `deploy/landing/wallet.js` — WebCrypto envelope (PBKDF2-SHA-256 →
    AES-256-GCM) with byte-identical parameters to `pkg/keystore`. The
    keystore JSON produced in the browser is interchangeable with the
    one produced by the CLI; an offline test (`_tmp_xcompat.js`) reads a
    CLI-generated keystore via Node's WebCrypto and signs through the
    WASM successfully.
  - `scripts/build_wallet_wasm.sh` — operator script: compiles WASM,
    copies `wasm_exec.js` from the local Go toolchain, drops both into
    `deploy/landing/`.
- **`pkg/wasm_modules/wallet/walletcrypto/crypto.go`** rewritten as a
  thin wrapper over `cloudflare/circl/sign/mldsa/mldsa87` (no liboqs,
  no CGO) so the same code compiles for CGO + non-CGO + WASM. The
  previous build-tag stubs (`crypto_stub.go` and the CGO-side stub) are
  deleted; both returned `wallet crypto: use pkg/crypto/dilithium.go
  instead` and broke the WASM `init()` path.
- **Documentation**: `docs/docs/WEB_WALLET.md` (threat model, keystore
  schema, deployer checklist, practical recipes) and an updated
  `MINER_QUICKSTART.md §1a` ("Generate a reward address") that points
  at both the CLI and the browser path.
- **Landing-site nav update**: `deploy/landing/index.html` gains a
  *Wallet* link in the primary nav so visitors reach `/wallet.html`
  from the home page.

**Test status:**

```
ok  github.com/quantum-ledger/QSD/pkg/keystore           13.6 s   13 cases
ok  github.com/quantum-ledger/QSD/cmd/QSDcli             2.0 s   includes wallet build
ok  github.com/quantum-ledger/QSD/wasm_modules/wallet     0.8 s   sign+verify round-trip
ok  github.com/quantum-ledger/QSD/.../walletcore          0.2 s   was skipping before this change
```

Plus offline:

- `_tmp_wasm_smoke.js` (Node) — instantiates `wallet.wasm`, runs
  generate / sign / verify / verify-reject / address-derive. All pass.
- `_tmp_xcompat.js` (Node) — reads a CLI-generated keystore, decrypts
  via Node's `crypto.webcrypto.subtle` with the keystore's parameters,
  signs the recovered private key via WASM, verifies against the
  keystore's `public_key`. All pass.

Both Node scripts are temp/`.gitignored` and rebuildable from the
patterns above; the in-repo Go tests are the binding contract.

### Session 83 — wallet live on QSD.tech + CSP fix + Go deploy tool

The Session 82 artefacts existed in-repo but were not yet on the public
edge. This session pushed them and fixed the one CSP gap that would
have blocked the browser wallet from running even after the static
files landed.

**Live deploy (QSD.tech, BLR1 validator, 206.189.132.232):**

```
sha256(/var/www/QSD/wallet.html)   = f57e6e58…ff9c9   (18,804 B)
sha256(/var/www/QSD/wallet.js)     = 41e9247c…79c6dea (18,371 B)
sha256(/var/www/QSD/wallet.wasm)   = 928bea8f…229676  (3,237,388 B)
sha256(/var/www/QSD/wasm_exec.js)  = 0c949f49…acba14  (16,992 B)
sha256(/var/www/QSD/index.html)    = 6e1a3eb4…001a328 (85,044 B, adds /wallet.html nav link)
```

A full backup of the prior `/var/www/QSD` was tarred to
`/root/landing-backups/landing-20260511T182420Z.tgz` (307 MB; includes
historical release directories) and the prior Caddyfile to
`/root/landing-backups/Caddyfile-20260511T182420Z.bak`. Rollback is a
single `tar xzf` + `caddy restart`.

**Caddyfile Content-Security-Policy gap fixed.** The previous policy
was `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`, which under CSP Level 3 is
sufficient for inline `<script>` tags but **not** for
`WebAssembly.instantiate()` — the browser would have failed the WASM
load with *"Refused to compile or instantiate WebAssembly module
because 'wasm-unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of script"*. Added
the minimal delta `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`. This is strictly narrower than
`'unsafe-eval'`: it allows `WebAssembly.{instantiate,compile}` but
*not* `eval()`, `Function()`, or `setTimeout(string, …)`. The rest of
the CSP (style-src, img-src, connect-src to api/dashboard subdomains
only, `frame-ancestors 'none'`) is unchanged.

Caddy's admin API is intentionally disabled in our config (`admin off`
in the global block, since we don't expose it on a listening port and
have no operational use for hot-reload short of a graceful restart),
so `caddy reload` returned `connect: connection refused` on
`localhost:2019`. Used `systemctl restart caddy` instead. The restart
was clean: all three listeners (`:443` apex, `:8443` API,
`:8081` dashboard) came back in under one second.

**Public-edge verification (Node `webassembly.instantiate` via curl
→ Go runtime shim):**

```
VERSION  : "QSD-wallet v1 / ml-dsa-87 / circl"
PUB hex  : 5184 chars  (= 2592 B, ML-DSA-87 spec)
PRIV hex : 9792 chars  (= 4896 B, ML-DSA-87 spec)
ADDR     : 605ab7550bd6c74ce3e5b394c1f6334cea0f6e2951938ae7fc5c775a7e1ac7e2
SIG hex  : 9254 chars  (= 4627 B, ML-DSA-87 spec)
VERIFY   : true
TAMPER   : false    (1-byte message edit → signature rejected)
```

Source for the smoke-test was a Node script that `curl`s
`https://QSD.tech/wallet.wasm` + `wasm_exec.js`, instantiates them in
a fresh `Go` runtime, and round-trips sign+verify. Temp, not
committed; the binding contract is the in-tree `pkg/keystore` and
`wasm_modules/wallet/*` Go tests.

**New operator tool: `cmd/QSD-deploy-landing`.** A small Go binary
that takes `-file LOCAL=REMOTE` mappings and `-run "shell …"` steps,
dials the VPS over SSH with the local `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, uploads
each file by piping through `cat > <remote>`, and runs each remote
command with live stdout/stderr. Replaces the historical pattern of
`python QSD/deploy/remote_*_paramiko.py` for the landing-site case —
this workstation's `pip` is broken (MSYS2 MinGW Python 3.12 ships
without `ensurepip` functional), so the Python path was unavailable
without a Python detour. The Go path needs only `go build` from the
existing toolchain. The tool is general (host/user via flag or
`QSD_VPS_HOST` / `QSD_VPS_USER` env vars; key via `-key`); it is not
landing-specific by design.

**Endpoint health after deploy:**

| URL | HTTP | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `https://QSD.tech/` | 200 | index.html with new `/wallet.html` nav link |
| `https://QSD.tech/wallet.html` | 200 | text/html; 18,804 B |
| `https://QSD.tech/wallet.wasm` | 200 | application/wasm; 3,237,388 B |
| `https://QSD.tech/wasm_exec.js` | 200 | text/javascript; 16,992 B |
| `https://QSD.tech/wallet.js` | 200 | text/javascript; 18,371 B |
| `https://api.QSD.tech/api/v1/health` | 200 | validator JSON API alive |
| `https://dashboard.QSD.tech/` | 302 | dashboard redirect to login (unchanged behaviour) |

**What did NOT change:**

- No new server-side endpoint, no validator schema change, no
  consensus change. The wallet emits a `QSD…` address derived as
  `hex(sha256(public_key))` — identical to the validator-side
  `pkg/wallet.NewWalletService` derivation. A wallet generated by
  either flow is immediately usable as a `--address` flag on
  `QSDminer` and as the `to`/`from` field on `/api/v1/wallet/send`.

**Roadmap items deliberately deferred:**

- A "send transaction" tab on the browser wallet (depends on v2 mining
  envelope format stabilising; planned for v0.4.0).
- Mnemonic / BIP-39-style seed phrase. ML-DSA-87 keys do not have a
  deterministic short representation; the encrypted JSON keystore is
  the recovery artefact. Documented as such in `WEB_WALLET.md §6`.

### Session 84 — homepage rewrite + secondary-page navigation parity

After deploying the wallet in Session 83 the public landing was
out-of-date: no mention of the wallet beyond a single nav link, the
SDK install snippet still showed the pre-rename `QSD` package, no
visible release version, and the four secondary pages (`chain.html`,
`validators.html`, `trust.html`, `download.html`) had no link to
`/wallet.html` — a visitor who deep-linked into Trust or Validators
could not discover the wallet without going back to `/`.

**`index.html` rewrite.** Cut from 1,479 lines / 85,044 B to
845 lines / ~44,000 B without losing any current information.
Restructured around three top-level sections: **Use** (cards for
Wallet / Mine / Validate, with one-click links into the deployed
flows), **Build** (developer-facing — `npm install QSD-sdk`,
`go get`, WASM, REST API, `docker pull ghcr.io/quantum-ledger/QSD`),
and **Why** (the existing benefits, condensed and de-duplicated).
Added a version pill in the nav showing the current release tag
(`v0.3.1`). The pill fetches `/api/v1/status` on load and shows
whatever is reported; an inline filter rejects strings matching
`/^go\d+(\.\d+){1,2}$/` so the validator's accidental publication of
its Go toolchain version (`go1.25.9`, currently in the field) cannot
overwrite the release tag with a misleading value. Architecture SVG
updated to include the wallet box on the user-facing side.

**Secondary page navigation parity.** Audited `chain.html`,
`validators.html`, `trust.html`, `download.html` and added a `Wallet`
link to each. Expanded `trust.html`'s nav (previously just a
"← Back to landing" link) to a full Home / Wallet / Validators /
Chain / Download set so deep-link traffic from search engines or
Sigstore-Rekor links has the same discovery surface as the homepage.

**Deploy:** all five HTML files pushed via `cmd/QSD-deploy-landing`
with a pre-run tar backup of `/var/www/QSD` to
`/root/landing-backups/landing-pre-s84.tgz`. No Caddyfile change. No
validator-side change.

### Session 85 — wallet SRI hardening + read-only balance lookup

Two narrow, additive improvements to the deployed wallet at
`https://QSD.tech/wallet.html`. No consensus change, no server-side
change, no Caddyfile change. Public edge re-verified end-to-end after
the deploy.

**1) Subresource Integrity (SRI) is now enforced on every loadable
sub-resource the wallet page consumes.** This closes the deferred item
from *Session 83*. Three sha384 hashes are pinned:

| File | Pinned in | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `/wasm_exec.js` | `wallet.html` | `<script integrity="sha384-…" crossorigin="anonymous">` |
| `/wallet.js`    | `wallet.html` | `<script integrity="sha384-…" crossorigin="anonymous">` |
| `/wallet.wasm`  | `wallet.js`   | `fetch('/wallet.wasm', { integrity: 'sha384-…' })` |

If any of these bytes differ from the pinned hash, the browser refuses
the load and surfaces a visible error rather than executing the rogue
code path. `wallet.html` is at the root of the trust chain — it is
itself fetched fresh on every page load — so its integrity is bounded
by HTTPS + the operator's control of `/var/www/QSD/wallet.html`. SRI
extends that root-of-trust to the three sub-resources, which is the
class of attack SRI was designed for (CDN swap, cached-asset poisoning,
operator-error overwrite of one file but not the HTML).

`QSD/scripts/build_wallet_wasm.sh` now rotates all three hashes
automatically (`openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A`) in
dependency order — wasm_exec.js → wallet.wasm → wallet.js → wallet.html
— and `--refresh-sri-only` is a new flag that re-pins the hashes from
on-disk artefacts without re-running the `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build`
(useful for HTML/JS-only edits). The script `grep`-asserts every
substitution actually took effect so a future template error can't ship
a stale-hash wallet.

End-to-end public-edge verification after deploy:

```
on-the-wire sha384 vs pinned (Caddy → curl → SHA-384 → compare to
attribute literal):

  /wasm_exec.js   PWCs+V4B…  ⇄  pinned in wallet.html  →  MATCH
  /wallet.js      7QOp7prD…  ⇄  pinned in wallet.html  →  MATCH
  /wallet.wasm    yHrwzrXe…  ⇄  pinned in wallet.js    →  MATCH
```

**2) New "Check balance" tab on the wallet.** A fourth tab alongside
Generate / Open / Sign. The user types or pastes any QSD address
(64 hex chars), the page sends a single
`GET https://api.QSD.tech/api/v1/wallet/balance?address=<addr>` (the
endpoint is public — `pkg/api/middleware.go` exempts it from auth so
game servers and explorers can poll), and the balance is rendered as
`X.YYYYYYYY CELL` plus the raw JSON for operators who want to see
exactly what the validator returned.

The Generate and Open tabs now also feed the address they just
produced into a "Use my last address" shortcut on the Balance pane —
mostly a UX nicety so a freshly-minted wallet can be checked in one
click. AbortController bounds the fetch at 12 s so a slow validator
doesn't leave the UI spinning forever. The endpoint's response shape
(`{ "address": "<echo>", "balance": <float CELL> }`) is sanity-checked
against the requested address so a MITM that rewrites the JSON in
flight can't silently substitute a different account's balance — the
UI surfaces a clear "address mismatch" error in that case.

The page copy now explicitly differentiates the network behaviour of
each tab: Generate / Open / Sign remain pure-browser (no POST, no GET
of anything beyond the three static files); Balance is the one tab
that contacts the network, and only after an explicit button click.
That precision is important — the original page promised "no network",
which would have become subtly false the moment Balance shipped.

**Deployed files (sha384, byte size):**

```
/var/www/QSD/wallet.html   sha384-EHFEu4ZH…  21,572 B   (+2,768 B vs s83)
/var/www/QSD/wallet.js     sha384-7QOp7prD…  25,780 B   (+7,409 B vs s83)
/var/www/QSD/wallet.wasm   sha384-yHrwzrXe…   3,237,388 B   (unchanged)
/var/www/QSD/wasm_exec.js  sha384-PWCs+V4B…  16,992 B   (unchanged)
```

Backup of the prior pair at `/root/backups/wallet.{html,js}.bak-20260512-031728`
on BLR1. Roll-back is `cp …bak-… /var/www/QSD/<file>` + chown.

**Deploy tool fix (`cmd/QSD-deploy-landing`).** No code change this
session — but discovered that PowerShell on Windows expands `$(date …)`
locally before sending the shell command to the remote, so a literal
`$(date …)` in a `-pre-run` flag fails with "Cannot bind parameter
'Date'". Documented in operator commentary; the fix on the caller side
is to compute the timestamp via `(Get-Date).ToString(…)` in PowerShell
and pass it as a plain string. The deploy tool itself is OS-agnostic.

**Verified working end-to-end:**

```
$ curl -s https://QSD.tech/wallet.html | grep -c 'data-tab="balance"'   → 1
$ curl -s https://QSD.tech/wallet.js   | grep -c 'BALANCE_ENDPOINT'    → 1
$ curl -s 'https://api.QSD.tech/api/v1/wallet/balance?address=605ab7…' →
  {"address":"605ab7…","balance":0}      # public, no auth header
```

### Session 86 — full v1 deprecation: status posture, miner preflight, release matrix, doc rewrite

User instruction: *"do it all by yourself. make sure v1 is no longer
an option for everybody."* Closes the audit gap surfaced in session
85, where the live mainnet has been v2-only at consensus
(`FORK_V2_HEIGHT = 0` since the Phase-4 chain reset) but several
user-facing surfaces still suggested v1 was a viable path. Six
coordinated changes — all consensus-neutral, all additive.

**1) `/api/v1/status` now self-advertises the v2 posture.** New
`mining` block (`pkg/api/handlers_status.go`):

```json
"mining": {
  "protocol_versions_accepted": [2],
  "fork_v2_height":              0,
  "fork_v2_active":             true,
  "fork_v2_tc_height":           <varies>,
  "fork_v2_tc_active":          false,
  "attestation_types_required": ["nvidia-cc-v1","nvidia-hmac-v1"],
  "min_enroll_stake_dust":      1000000000
}
```

The booleans fold `(scheduled? & reached?)` into a single field so
clients don't have to reason about the `math.MaxUint64` sentinel
that means "fork not yet scheduled". The height fields are
`omitempty` so a v1-only validator emits a clean minimal payload.
Implementation reads `mining.ForkV2Height()` / `ForkV2TCHeight()`
atomically and computes activeness against the current chain tip
— same logic the verifier uses for proof admission, so the
posture the endpoint reports is the posture the verifier enforces.

**2) Both miners refuse to start v1 against a v2-active validator
(`pkg/mining/preflight`).** A new helper package fetches
`/api/v1/status`, parses the `mining` block, and returns one of
`DecisionProceedV{1,2}` / `DecisionRefuseV1`. Both `cmd/QSDminer`
and `cmd/QSDminer-console` call this immediately after flag parse
and *before* entering the mining loop:

- v2-active validator + v1 caller → refuse + exit 3 with a banner
  pointing operators at `QSDminer-console --protocol=v2` and the
  MINER_QUICKSTART.md.
- v1 validator + v1 caller → proceed; banner explains.
- Probe failure (network, parse error, older validator without the
  `mining` block) → fail-OPEN with a warning so a degraded
  `/api/v1/status` doesn't lock out local devnet usage.
- `--allow-v1` (CLI flag) / `allow_v1 = true` (miner.toml) bypasses
  the refusal for forensic / replay use, with a loud "all submitted
  proofs WILL be rejected" warning printed to stderr.

The probe shape was deliberately implemented without a dependency
on `pkg/api.StatusResponse` to avoid an import cycle and to make
the miner brittle-resistant to future status-schema growth.
Comprehensive unit coverage (`preflight_test.go`, 9 cases) exercises
all 8 (validator state × caller posture × probe success) cells of
the decision table.

**3) `cmd/QSDminer` is no longer a public release artefact.**
`.github/workflows/release-container.yml` no longer cross-compiles
or cosign-signs the v1 reference miner; the artefact list in the
header comment and the asset-glob in the aggregator job are both
trimmed to `QSDminer-console-*`, `trustcheck-*`,
`genesis-ceremony-*`. Two reasons documented in the workflow:
(a) every v1 proof against mainnet is rejected at consensus, so a
shipped binary would mis-route operators into a guaranteed-reject
loop; (b) reproducibility — the binary stays in-tree so any
auditor can `go build ./cmd/QSDminer` from a tagged commit and
verify it byte-for-byte against the SBOM. `QSD-split-profile.yml`
keeps the `QSDminer --self-test` CI gate alive as a canary on the
v1 ComputeMixDigest code path (the verifier still ingests historical
v1 blocks if any chain ever produces them), but drops `QSDminer`
from the `--version` ldflags-injection smoke (no release binary →
nothing to stamp).

**4) `QSD/docs/docs/MINER_QUICKSTART.md` rewritten v2-first.** The
top of the document used to lead with "install QSDminer →
self-test → connect to validator". That sequence is wrong for any
2026-mainnet operator: they need an enrolled NVIDIA GPU and a
bonded 10 CELL stake before any miner binary will produce
accepted work. The rewrite reorders the doc into a v2-mainnet flow
(`§1 Requirements → §2 Reward address → §3 HMAC key + on-chain
enrollment → §4 Mine → §5 Lifecycle commands`), demotes the
original §2 / §3 (CPU install + validator-discovery + systemd
unit) to **Appendix A. v1 audit / local-devnet builds** with an
explicit "Mainnet operators: this section is not for you" header,
and adds the §1a "self-detect the validator's posture" callout
that documents how `/api/v1/status.mining` is the canonical source
of truth.

**5) Homepage Mine card + wallet Balance-tab help.** The
`index.html#mine` article now reads "v2 only" with the explicit
"v1 CPU path is rejected at consensus (`ReasonBadVersion`) and the
v1 reference binary is no longer a public release artefact"
disclaimer, a Hardware / Tooling / On-chain / Funding-caveat
bullet list, and a link to the new Appendix B. The wallet's
"Check balance" tab help text now points operators at
`QSDcli enroll` + `QSDminer-console --protocol=v2` and surfaces
the funding caveat. SHA-384 SRI of `wallet.js` was rotated by
`build_wallet_wasm.sh --refresh-sri-only`; `wallet.wasm` is
unchanged.

**6) New "Appendix B. Enrollment-funding status" in
MINER_QUICKSTART.md — an honest audit.** The chain reset at
FORK_V2_HEIGHT=0 zeroed total supply, so a fresh outside operator
who follows the v2 enrollment flow hits an `insufficient_balance`
rejection from the admission gate at the 10 CELL stake step. The
appendix walks the four funding routes:

- *Initial-operator allocation* — none on the live chain as of
  v0.3.2. The single-operator genesis allocation went to the
  validator-operator's own miner address.
- *Reward from your own v2 proofs* — circular: requires enrollment,
  which requires CELL.
- *Peer transfer* — possible via `/api/v1/transactions`; the
  browser wallet's *Send transaction* tab is a deferred v0.4 item.
- *Public bootstrap faucet* — **not yet shipped**. The string
  `faucet` does not occur anywhere in `QSD/source/` (verified by
  `grep -ri faucet QSD/`).

The appendix also documents the broken `/api/v1/wallet/mint`
endpoint: it is publicly callable, returns HTTP 200 with
`status:"minted"`, and **does not credit the recipient's balance**
(a `GET /api/v1/wallet/balance?address=<recipient>` after a
successful POST returns the recipient's pre-mint balance unchanged).
The endpoint is documented in `pkg/api/middleware.go publicPaths`
as "Public for game server to mint $CELL" — a stub for an external
authoritative service that was never wired up. Treat as no-op.

This appendix is the deliverable for the previously-open audit
item *enroll-funding*. The practical answer for a fresh outside
operator today is "social-bootstrap (ask an existing holder for
10 CELL) or run a local devnet"; the faucet build-out is now the
project's highest-priority operator-funding work item.

**Consensus / wire compatibility.** The new `/api/v1/status.mining`
block is additive (older SDK callers that don't know about it just
ignore the new field). The preflight refusal is a CLIENT-side
behaviour: no change to admission rules, no change to verifier, no
change to block format. The release-matrix drop is a release-time
packaging change only. Every test in the targeted sweep passes:

```

+ 17 other pkg/mining/* packages, all green
```

### Session 87 — v0.3.2 cut: deploy validator, tag, release pipeline

User instruction: *"set aside npm task, token is safe. do the others
by yourself."* The Session 86 changes existed in-repo at commit
`f727fef` but were not yet live on the public reference validator,
and the work in `v0.3.1..main` (homepage rewrite, wallet SRI,
balance tab, full v1 deprecation — four commits) was substantial
enough to warrant a release boundary. This session closes both.

**1) Cosign-state audit for v0.3.1 (resolved without action).**
`vps.txt §[9]` claimed `ghcr.io/quantum-ledger/QSD-validator:0.3.1`
was unsigned and recommended a manual `gh workflow run` re-trigger.
`cosign verify` against the live registry returns three signatures
attached to image digest `sha256:197f444c…04a72eb7`, all carrying
the expected `release-container.yml @ refs/tags/v0.3.1` GitHub OIDC
identity. The note was stale — a later cosign retry must have
filled the gap silently. `vps.txt §[9]` updated to reflect the
resolved state; **no re-run needed**.

**2) New validator binary deployed to api.QSD.tech.** Cross-compiled
`cmd/QSD` for linux/amd64 from `f727fef` with `-trimpath`
+ `-ldflags="-s -w"`, 32,428,216 bytes,
sha256 `9ad910bc2e0c5e9013ac45f27243a275dbcc296444211057b352ceb00aee91e0`.
SCP'd to BLR1 (`206.189.132.232:/tmp/QSD.new`), uploaded sha256
re-verified on the host, old binary copied to
`/opt/QSD/QSD.bak.20260511T200112Z` (44 MB — previous build was
not stripped). New systemd drop-in
`/etc/systemd/system/QSD.service.d/version.conf` installed with
`QSD_BUILD_VERSION=v0.3.2` + the legacy `QSDPLUS_BUILD_VERSION`
alias (dual-emit per the Major Update §6 convention).
`systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl start QSD` → `is-active`.
Post-restart `GET https://api.QSD.tech/api/v1/status`:

```json
{
  "version": "v0.3.2",
  "chain_tip": 41873,
  "peers": 202,
  "mining": {
    "protocol_versions_accepted": [2],
    "fork_v2_active": true,
    "fork_v2_tc_active": false,
    "attestation_types_required": ["nvidia-cc-v1","nvidia-hmac-v1"],
    "min_enroll_stake_dust": 1000000000
  }
}
```

Chain + accounts + enrollments + receipts all restored from disk
(41872 blocks, 28 accounts, 3 enrollments, 40565 receipts) — the
on-disk state machine survived the binary swap cleanly.

**Known post-deploy blip (self-recovering).** The libp2p host
identity is not yet persisted across QSD.service restarts (the
key is regenerated each boot), so `node_id` changed from
`12D3KooWKWPUeH…` → `12D3KooWBY9zdQ…`. Pre-restart attestation
rows submitted under the old `node_id` are now outside the 15-min
freshness window, so
`/api/v1/trust/attestations/summary.attested` dropped to 0
immediately after the restart. The first scheduled
`Trust transparency external probe` after the tag push turned red
for this reason — it enforces `min_attested >= 2`. Recovery is
automatic on the next NGC sidecar tick (BLR1 local timer + OCI
SGP1 sidecar each POST a fresh proof bundle within ~10 min),
after which `attested` returns to 2 and the next scheduled probe
goes green again. Filed `libp2p-key-persist` as a follow-up:
a one-line persistence of the host PrivateKey to
`/opt/QSD/host_key.pem` would eliminate this blip entirely.

**3) `v0.3.2` annotated tag cut + pushed.** Pushed to
`origin/v0.3.2` at commit `f727fef` (Session-86 deliverable).
The tag annotation enumerates the v0.3.0..v0.3.2 highlights:
v1 deprecation, browser wallet hardening, landing rewrite, doc
overhaul, container-image cosign coverage. Push triggered the
expected release matrix:

```
Release container        — in_progress (signs binaries + images)
QSD Go                  — in_progress (lint + unit + race)
QSD split-profile build — in_progress (multi-profile build matrix)
QSD Scylla staging verify — in_progress
macOS build              — queued
Validate deploy manifests — success
Trust transparency probe — failure (post-restart blip, see above)
```

A follow-up housekeeping commit (`gitignore: add _build/`) landed
on `main` after the tag was created, so v0.3.2 is locked to the
clean v1-deprecation diff. The `_build/` ignore picks up in any
future tag.

**Files touched (Session 87):**

```
vps.txt                                    — §[9] cosign state RESOLVED (untracked, gitignored)
.gitignore                                 — +_build/ (post-tag housekeeping)
RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0.md                    — this entry

```

**Verification one-liner (any operator).**

```
curl -s https://api.QSD.tech/api/v1/status \
  | jq '{version, chain_tip, peers, mining}'
```

…must include `version: "v0.3.2"` and a non-null `mining` block
with `fork_v2_active: true`. If the `mining` field is missing the
validator is running an older binary.

### Session 88 — truth-in-docs: NVIDIA hardware is not a blocker

User instruction (paraphrased from a follow-up question): *"I thought
real CUDA validation could be done by HMAC and the RTX 3050."* They
are correct, and the docs were stale. This session is a small
truth-in-docs pass that does not change behaviour but does remove
two misleading "Ops needs to buy hardware" lines from the release
narrative.

**What was investigated.**

  1. `pkg/mining/attest/dispatcher.go::VerifyAttestation` (lines
     144-155) dispatches an incoming v2 proof to the
     `AttestationVerifier` matching `Attestation.Type`. The
     `attestation_types_required` field on `/api/v1/status.mining` is
     an **OR**-set of acceptable types — a proof carrying
     `nvidia-hmac-v1` is fully accepted at consensus even when
     `nvidia-cc-v1` is also listed.
  2. `pkg/mining/attest/archcheck/archcheck.go` registers
     `ArchAmpere` (line 127) with GPU-name patterns covering
     `"rtx 30"`, `"a2"`, `"a4"`, `"a10"`, `"a16"` (lines 235-262)
     and an accepted hashrate band of `[50 KH/s, 50 MH/s]` for
     Ampere consumer SKUs (lines 207-213). RTX 3050 is in band.
  3. `QSD/docs/docs/MESH3D_GPU_BENCHMARK.md` already pins a
     reference run from 2026-04-23 on the exact silicon: RTX 3050
     (CC 8.6, driver 576.28, CUDA 12.9), 4.06× over a 32-thread
     Xeon at n=4096 cells on the validate path, 2.23× on hash-only.
  4. `QSD/docs/docs/ATTESTATION_SIDECARS.md` lists
     `QSD-windows-dev` (the same Windows dev box, RTX 3050, CC 8.6)
     as an already-configured attestation source.

The cumulative consequence: the previous wording in
`RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0.md` "Remaining external blockers" that grouped
*NVIDIA hardware + nvcc toolchain* as a blocker was wrong. Both have
been on a reference dev box for over two weeks, and the kernel-
execution path **was** validated in repo on that hardware. The
remaining gap is the end-to-end live mining session — actually
running the `-tags cuda` build of `QSDminer-console` against
`api.QSD.tech`, submitting an HMAC-attested v2 proof, and observing
it accepted at consensus.

**Files touched (Session 88).**

RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0.md                         — this entry; "NVIDIA hardware" row removed
                                                  from the "Remaining external blockers"
                                                  table; replaced by a clearer "Cleared in
                                                  v0.3.2" callout pointing at the new
                                                  cookbook + the existing benchmark.
QSD/docs/docs/RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md              — "Real-GPU CUDA validation" bullet rewritten
                                                  to reference MESH3D_GPU_BENCHMARK.md
                                                  (kernel-execution numbers DO exist on
                                                  RTX 3050; only the live mining session
                                                  is residual).

                                                  bumped v0.3.1 → v0.3.2 (4 places:

```

**What is NOT changed.** `pkg/audit/checklist.go` is unmodified —
the existing items (`mining-01` external audit, `mining-05`
incentivised testnet, etc.) are still pending; they were correctly
characterised. No source-code, config, or chain state changes; this
session is documentation only.

**Verification.** `MESH3D_GPU_BENCHMARK.md` is self-reproducing —
any operator with an RTX 3050 + CUDA 12.x + MSVC 2017 build tools
can rerun the benchmark and compare against the table. The cookbook
is self-contained against `MINER_QUICKSTART.md` and the live
validator status, so any future revisions of the v2 protocol that
break the recipe will surface immediately.

### Session 89 — libp2p host key persistence

User instruction (paraphrased): *"what's next?"* → recommended
closing the `libp2p-key-persist` follow-up filed at the end of
Session 87. Did so; deployed and verified.

**The fix.** `pkg/networking/hostkey.go::loadOrCreateHostKey` loads
a base64-encoded `libp2p.MarshalPrivateKey` blob from a configured
on-disk path, or generates and persists a fresh Ed25519 keypair at
0600 (atomic tmp+rename) if the file is missing. The new
`SetupLibP2PWithPortAndKey(ctx, logger, port, hostKeyPath)` plumbs
that key into `libp2p.Identity(...)`. The two older constructors
(`SetupLibP2P`, `SetupLibP2PWithPort`) keep working — they pass an
empty path, which preserves the legacy ephemeral-identity behaviour
expected by tests and devnets.

**Config surface (one new knob).**
  * `Config.NetworkHostKeyPath` (Go), `[network] host_key_path` (TOML),
    `network.host_key_path` (YAML), `QSD_NETWORK_HOST_KEY_PATH` (env).
  * Empty by default → ephemeral, identical to v0.3.2 behaviour.
  * Set to a path (e.g. `/opt/QSD/host_key`) on production → load
    or create; key is preserved across QSD.service restarts.

**Tests added (13/13 green).**
`pkg/networking/hostkey_test.go` covers: empty path,
whitespace-only path, create-then-reload identity stability,
corrupted-file error messages that mention the path so an operator
can grep them out of `journalctl -u QSD`, missing parent directory
(we don't auto-mkdir behind the operator's back), path-is-a-
directory, end-to-end peer.ID stability via two
`SetupLibP2PWithPortAndKey` calls against the same path, and empty
path keeps producing distinct ephemeral identities (so the legacy
contract is preserved). Broader `go test -short
./pkg/networking/... ./pkg/config/...` is 114/114.

**Production deploy (api.QSD.tech, BLR1).**

verdict:      PASS — libp2p peer.ID is stable across QSD.service restart.
```

The deploy did roll the node_id one final time (`12D3KooWBY9zdQ...` →
`12D3KooWRH4...`). Future restarts will preserve `12D3KooWRH4...`.

**Honest scope note — what this does and does NOT fix.**
The original Session 87 hypothesis was that the libp2p node_id roll
caused the `Trust transparency external probe` to fail for ~8 min
after every restart. Investigation during this session shows that
the NGC attestation sidecar identifies its bundles by a config-set
identifier (`QSDplus_node_id=vps-blr1-validator`, from
`QSD_NGC_PROOF_NODE_ID`) — NOT by the libp2p peer.ID. So the
trust-attestation freshness check is decoupled from the libp2p
key, and the real post-restart blip is the validator's in-memory
"accepted attestation" ring buffer being wiped on every restart.
Pre-restart bundles posted to `/api/v1/monitoring/ngc-proofs` do
not survive the restart, so the trust summary momentarily reports
`attested=0` until the next sidecar tick (≤10 min on BLR1, ≤10 min
on OCI SGP1) re-fills the ring.

That residual issue is filed as a new follow-up
**`trust-attest-persist`**: persist the accepted-attestation ring
to disk (mirror what `recentrejections.FilePersister` does for
rejections — same pattern, same atomic-write-with-compaction shape).
Out of scope for Session 89.

What `libp2p-key-persist` **does** fix is everything that IS keyed
by the libp2p peer.ID:
  * Bootstrap-peer allowlists that whitelist us by peer.ID
    (currently we'd need to update those every restart).
  * P2P topology graphs and `QSD_p2p_peers_*` metrics — same
    physical node now appears as the same logical node across
    restarts.
  * The `node_id` field on `/api/v1/status`, dashboards, and
    external probes.

**New follow-up filed:** `trust-attest-persist` — persist

### Session 90 — NGC attestation ring persistence (closes `trust-attest-persist`)

User instruction (paraphrased): *"what's next?"* → recommended
closing the `trust-attest-persist` follow-up filed at the end of
Session 89, because *that* is what actually fixes the post-restart
`attested=0` blip (the libp2p key change in Session 89 didn't —
the sidecar identifies bundles by a config-set `QSDplus_node_id`,
not the libp2p peer.ID). Did so; deployed and verified end-to-end.

**The fix.** A new `pkg/monitoring/ngc_proof_persist.go` mirrors
the pattern proven in `pkg/mining/attest/recentrejects/persistence.go`:
JSONL append-only with crash-recovery framing (partial-write tail
defence: pre-pend `\n` if the file's last byte isn't a newline,
so a half-written record can't run together with the next one),
atomic-rename compaction at a soft cap that matches the in-memory
ring size (32 records), corruption-tolerant load that skips lines
which fail `json.Unmarshal`, mode `0600`, error counter
(`NGCProofPersistErrors()`) and on-disk gauge
(`NGCProofPersistRecordsOnDisk()`).

`appendNGCProofRawLocked` (the single mutation point of the
in-memory ring in `ngc_proofs.go`) now calls `appendNGCProofToDisk`
after every successful in-memory append. Filesystem failures are
**best-effort**: they bump `NGCProofPersistErrors()` but never
block the in-memory ring update, so the dashboard and
`/api/v1/trust/attestations/summary` stay accurate even with a
full disk — the operator-facing degradation surface is the error
counter, not lost telemetry.

`cmd/QSD/main.go` calls `monitoring.SetNGCProofPersistPath` +
`monitoring.RestoreNGCProofsFromDisk` **before** the API server
binds, so a fresh boot replays pre-restart bundles into the in-
memory ring before any new POST `/api/v1/monitoring/ngc-proof`
can overwrite them. The replay path is logged with a structured
INFO line: `"NGC proof persistence: replayed pre-restart bundles
into in-memory ring","path":"…","records_restored":N`. (Two
companion log lines cover the "no records to restore" and
"persistence disabled — operator chose ephemeral" branches.)

**Config surface (one new knob).**
  * `Config.NGCProofPersistPath` (Go), `[monitoring] ngc_proof_persist_path`
    (TOML), `monitoring.ngc_proof_persist_path` (YAML),
    `QSD_NGC_PROOF_PERSIST_PATH` (env).
  * Empty by default → in-memory-only ring (legacy v0.3.2 behaviour).
  * Set to a path (e.g. `/opt/QSD/ngc_proofs.jsonl`) → the in-
    memory ring is mirrored to disk; restart no longer loses
    accepted attestations.

**Tests added (6/6 green; broader suite 154/154).**
`pkg/monitoring/ngc_proof_persist_test.go` covers:

  * empty path is a no-op (no I/O, no errors, no records-on-disk);
  * round-trip — three bundles record → restore preserves all three
    `NGCProofDistinctByNodeID` rows; file is mode `0600` and
    contains exactly three newline-terminated lines;
  * corrupt tail line is skipped on load (simulated half-written
    JSON with no trailing newline);
  * compaction caps the file at `softCap` after `2*softCap` writes
    (smoke test uses `softCap=4` so we don't need 32+ records);
  * empty-file restore returns `(0, nil)`;
  * missing parent directory produces an actionable error message
    that mentions the parent path so an operator can fix it from
    `journalctl -u QSD`.

`go test -short ./pkg/monitoring/... ./pkg/config/...` → 154/154.

**Production deploy (api.QSD.tech, BLR1).**

              post-restart `attested=0` blip described in
              Session 89's "honest scope note" is closed.
```

**Operator behaviour change.**
The next time `QSD.service` restarts (planned or unplanned),
`/api/v1/trust/attestations/summary.attested` will **not** drop
to zero. The freshness window in the validator (default 15 min
via `Config.TrustFreshWithin`) still applies — a bundle whose
`timestamp_utc` is older than that window is excluded from the
"attested" count even if it lives in the ring — so a multi-hour
outage will eventually exit freshness and require fresh sidecar
ticks. Steady-state operation (sidecar tick every ≤10 min on
BLR1 + ≤10 min on OCI SGP1) keeps the ring continuously fresh.

### Session 91 — `/api/v1/wallet/mint` deprecated to 410 Gone

User instruction (paraphrased): *"do it yourself"* → continued the
"top of the queue" ranking from the end of Session 90 and dropped
the misleading `/api/v1/wallet/mint` stub flagged in the Session 85
audit.

**What was wrong.** The endpoint was on `publicPaths` in
`pkg/api/middleware.go` with the comment *"Public for game server
to mint $CELL (main coin)"*. The handler validated input,
optionally enforced `nvidia_lock` + submesh policy, logged a mint
line, **stored a `{"type":"mint","coin":"CELL",…}` envelope into
the transaction log**, and returned HTTP 200 with
`status:"minted"`. But **no code path connected the handler to the
wallet service's `AddBalance` operation**, so a follow-up
`GET /api/v1/wallet/balance?address=<recipient>` always returned 0.
On the BLR1 production node `nvidia_lock` is disabled, which meant
in practice any caller could POST `/api/v1/wallet/mint` and the
validator would write a phantom mint record — an open
supply-inflation log surface with no actual ledger effect, but
also no actual functionality. The Session 85 audit flagged this as
"a non-functional stub that creates a misleading public surface".

**The fix.** Surgical, reversible, no removal of the URL itself:
the handler now returns **HTTP 410 Gone** with a structured JSON
body carrying a `migration` block that points callers at the two
real paths — `/api/v1/wallet/send` for peer transfers (the new-
operator funding path from `MINER_QUICKSTART.md` Appendix B) and
`/api/v1/tokens/mint` for named token minting (which IS wired
through the wallet service and DOES update balances). A new
`monitoring.WalletMintResultGone` tag (`QSD_wallet_mint_total{result="gone"}`)
fires on every call so operators can spot misconfigured callers
that still target the removed endpoint.

The function symbol (`MintMainCoin`), `MintMainCoinRequest`, and
`MintMainCoinResponse` types are retained so generated SDK code
still compiles — only the handler body changed. The route stays
in `publicPaths` so an external caller receives a clean 410 with
the migration JSON instead of a confusing 401 redirect to
`/api/auth/login`. The rate-limit entry in `security.go` stays as
well — defence in depth against a flood of removed-endpoint hits.

**Why 410 and not a flat removal of the route.**

  * Preserves the URL as a *documented, intentional* response.
    A 404 from a removed mux entry tells the caller nothing; a
    410 with a JSON `migration` block is self-documenting.
  * Doesn't break smoke tests or external probes that target the
    path (e.g. an `api.QSD.tech/api/v1/wallet/mint` health
    poke from a third party).
  * Keeps the `QSD_wallet_mint_total` exposition surface
    consistent. Dashboards / alerts that watch the counter
    (`QSDWalletMintBurst`) keep evaluating against present
    time-series instead of missing-data on a v0.3.3 node. The
    alert itself becomes a **regression tripwire** — if a
    future code revert restores the never-credited mint path,
    the alert fires at the 30-min threshold.
  * Trivially reversible if a real game-server integration ever
    materialises. The function body is the only code that
    changed; restoring real-mint behaviour would replace 6
    lines (with an `h.walletService.AddBalance(...)` call) plus
    re-enable the original 8 tests from git history.

**Test churn.** Eight mint-specific tests deleted (they all
asserted 200/403 behaviours of the never-credited stub —
`TestNvidiaLockMintMainCoin_*` × 7, `TestSubmeshMintMainCoin_*` × 1).
The NVIDIA-lock / HMAC / ingest-nonce / submesh-privileged-payload
code paths they exercised are still covered by the other consumers
(`/api/v1/wallet/send`, `/api/v1/tokens/mint`, etc.), so coverage
is preserved. Replaced with two new tests
(`TestWalletMint_410Gone`, `TestWalletMint_410GoneMethodNotAllowed`)
that pin the new posture: 410 with a well-formed `migration` JSON
block, and 405 still wins over 410 for non-POST methods.
`go test -short ./pkg/api/... ./pkg/monitoring/... ./pkg/config/...` → 378/378.

```

**Audit-checklist refresh (Session 91 follow-on).**

Two new audit rows were added alongside `api-05`:

  * **`net-05`** — libp2p host key persistence (closes Session
    89's deployed work in audit form: peer.ID stable across
    restarts via `Config.NetworkHostKeyPath`; the
    `pkg/networking/hostkey.go` atomic-write-with-0600 invariant;
    parent-dir-must-exist precondition).
  * **`store-05`** — was already added in Session 90 for the
    NGC ring persister; included here for completeness because
    the "At a glance" row's bump from 53→56 covers all three.

Total `pkg/audit/checklist.go` rows: **53 → 56** (full-suite
render including review-driven extras: 81 → 84).

**Production-deploy posture.** No emergency redeploy needed. The
v0.3.2-s90 binary on BLR1 still serves the v0.3.2 mint stub; the
410 lands the moment the next planned deploy ships. Practical
exposure today is bounded by the fact that no real caller targets
the endpoint (no game-server integration exists), so the surface
is theoretical until a malicious caller stumbles onto the path.

### Session 95 — v0.4.0 Phase A: `POST /api/v1/wallet/submit-signed` backend shipped

The v0.4 design surfaced in Session 94 (see
[`V040_WALLET_SEND_DESIGN.md`](QSD/docs/docs/V040_WALLET_SEND_DESIGN.md))
identified an architectural mismatch between the existing
`/api/v1/wallet/send` (which signs from the validator's own
wallet — `pkg/wallet/wallet.go::CreateTransaction` always sets
`Sender = ws.address` and ignores JWT claims) and the
self-custody browser-wallet use case where the user's private
key never leaves the browser. Session 95 closes Phase A of that
design: the **server-side backend is live in the source tree**;
Phase B (WASM `walletSignTransaction` helper + browser "Send"
tab + `wallet.wasm` rebuild + OpenAPI doc) is the next session's
deliverable.

**What landed:**

- **New handler** at `pkg/api/handlers.go::SubmitSignedTransaction`
  bound to `POST /api/v1/wallet/submit-signed`. Five invariants
  enforced on every request: (a) `sender == hex(sha256(public_key))`
  cryptographic binding (counter:
  `QSD_wallet_send_total{result="sender_mismatch"}`); (b) ML-DSA-87
  signature verified over the canonical payload (envelope JSON
  with `signature` + `public_key` cleared, then `json.Marshal`
  with Go's default struct-order field emission) against the
  envelope's own `public_key` — there is no codepath that falls
  back to a validator-side keypair (counter: `signature_invalid`);
  (c) pre-flight `storage.GetBalance(sender)` check returning
  HTTP 402 on shortfall (counter: `insufficient_balance`);
  (d) idempotency on `tx_id` via `storage.GetTransaction` —
  first call returns 200 + `status:"accepted"`, duplicate returns
  409 + `status:"duplicate"` (counter: `duplicate`); (e) every
  terminal path increments `QSD_wallet_send_total{result=...}`
  with one of `{success, invalid_request, sender_mismatch,
  signature_invalid, insufficient_balance, duplicate,
  store_failed, no_wallet_service}`.
- **Storage interface bump:** `pkg/api/server.go::StorageInterface`
  now includes `GetTransaction(txID string) (map[string]interface{}, error)`.
  All three backends (SQLite, Scylla, file-storage) already
  implement it; the local `Storage` interface in
  `cmd/QSD/main.go` was matched.
- **Monitoring:** `pkg/monitoring/wallet_metrics.go` gained four
  new result tags (`sender_mismatch`, `signature_invalid`,
  `insufficient_balance`, `duplicate`) on the
  `QSD_wallet_send_total` family. Exposition surface remains
  one counter per (endpoint, result) so existing dashboards keep
  evaluating against present series.
- **Public-path + rate-limit wiring:** `pkg/api/middleware.go`
  adds `/api/v1/wallet/submit-signed` to `publicPaths` (the
  cryptographic identity IS the envelope's `public_key` — JWT
  would add nothing); `pkg/api/security.go` caps it at 10 req/min
  per IP, identical to `/wallet/send`.
- **Tests:** 8-case matrix in `pkg/api/handlers_test.go`
  (`TestSubmitSigned_{HappyPath,MethodNotAllowed,MalformedJSON,SenderMismatch,BadSignature,DuplicateTxID,InsufficientBalance,NoWalletService}`)
  — all green on the non-CGO `circl/mldsa87` build. The mock
  storage was upgraded from "lies about every tx_id existing" to a
  real `transactions[txID]` indexed map so the idempotency tests
  can distinguish first-send from duplicate-send.
- **Audit row:** `api-06` flipped from "DESIGN PHASE" to
  "BACKEND IMPLEMENTED" with the known-gap list inline. Row
  count unchanged (56).

**Known v0.4.0 gaps shipped intentionally (tracked in
`V040_WALLET_SEND_DESIGN.md` Future work):**

1. **No per-account nonce.** A client controlling the nanosecond
   timestamp inside the `tx_id` seed can craft arbitrarily many
   distinct `tx_id`s for the same logical transfer. Same-`tx_id`
   replay IS prevented (the 409-duplicate path); cross-`tx_id`
   replay is NOT. Fix planned for **v0.4.1** (per-sender
   monotonically-increasing nonce, rejected if the new envelope's
   nonce ≤ the last-seen one for that sender).
2. **Non-atomic balance debit.**
   `pkg/storage/sqlite.go::UpdateBalance` warns-and-proceeds on
   negative balance (it logs `"Warning: failed to update sender
   balance"` but doesn't roll back). The pre-flight `GetBalance`
   check we do here closes the obvious case, but a concurrent
   race between two simultaneous submit-signed calls from the
   same sender can still drive the on-disk balance below zero.
   Fix planned for **v0.4.1** (single-transaction atomic
   debit/credit with a balance-non-negative `CHECK` constraint).

Both gaps must close before `mining-05` (incentivised testnet)
exposure. They are not a regression — `/wallet/send` has the
exact same posture today — but they ARE a real blocker for
public endpoint exposure on a balance-bearing chain.

**Production-deploy posture (at end-of-Session-95).** No emergency
push needed. v0.4.0 binaries do not exist yet on BLR1; the next
planned deploy will cut a `v0.4.0` tag (after Phase B closes) and
ship the self-custody endpoint alongside the existing
`/wallet/send`. The endpoint is in the source tree today
(`03edf41`→`HEAD`), so a private replay against a local
validator is straightforward via the `TestSubmitSigned_*` fixtures.

### Session 96 — v0.4.0 Phase B: WASM signing helper + browser Send tab shipped

Phase B of the v0.4 design closes the source-tree side of the
self-custody Send flow. With the v0.4.0 Phase A backend already in
place (Session 95), Phase B is what makes the new endpoint actually
useful to a browser user — without it the only callers would be
custom JS hand-built against the OpenAPI spec.

**What landed:**

- **WASM signing helper.**
  `QSD/source/wasm_modules/wallet/cmd/QSD-wallet/main.go` gains a
  new exported global `QSD_wallet_sign_transaction(envelope_json,
  private_key_hex, public_key_hex) → signed_envelope_json`. The
  helper (a) parses the envelope into a local `txEnvelope` struct
  that mirrors `pkg/wallet.TransactionData` field-for-field,
  (b) clears `signature` + `public_key`, (c) cross-checks that the
  envelope's `sender` matches `hex(sha256(public_key_hex))` —
  rejects with an inline error if not — (d) `json.Marshal`s the
  cleared envelope into the canonical signing-payload bytes (this
  is the byte-for-byte counterpart to the server-side canonical
  form; using Go's `json.Marshal` on both sides sidesteps the
  JS/Go float-format drift that bites on small fee values like
  `1e-7` → Go `"1e-07"` vs. JS `"1e-7"`), (e) ML-DSA-87-signs the
  canonical bytes via the existing `circl/mldsa87` codepath, and
  (f) re-marshals the final envelope with `signature` + `public_key`
  populated. The WASM module's `apiVersion` constant ticks
  `v1 → v2` so anyone caching the old build can fail-loud.
- **Browser Send tab.**
  `QSD/deploy/landing/wallet.html` gains a fifth tab `Send
  transaction` next to the existing Generate / Encrypt / Decrypt /
  Balance tabs. The form takes `recipient`, `amount`, `fee`,
  `geotag`, optional `parent_cells`, optional endpoint override,
  and an inline warning banner about the two v0.4.0 known gaps
  (no per-account nonce, non-atomic debit). The submit handler in
  `wallet.js` (a) reads the user's keystore file, (b) prompts for
  the keystore passphrase, (c) decrypts the ML-DSA-87 private key
  into a JS `Uint8Array` (zeroed on completion), (d) builds the
  unsigned envelope including a `tx_id` of
  `sha256(sender|recipient|amount|fee|geotag|nanoseconds)[:32]`,
  (e) invokes `QSD_wallet_sign_transaction`, and (f) POSTs the
  signed envelope to `/api/v1/wallet/submit-signed`. Result is
  rendered as a status line (success / 4xx-rejection / network
  error) that surfaces the server-emitted error reason verbatim.
- **WASM rebuild + SRI refresh.** `QSD/deploy/landing/wallet.wasm`
  grew from ~3.24 MB to ~3.88 MB to embed the new export
  (`QSD_wallet_sign_transaction` confirmed present via
  `wasm-objdump -x | grep` and again via a runtime
  `globalThis.QSD_wallet_sign_transaction` typeof check). SRI
  hashes refreshed:
  - `wallet.wasm` →
    `sha384-XKMSFMnk27ul5OLXqm2zFMPtsdSVUGNXK8sChbKc/Y2nIqVLEB330Ll+UDhz0Eb6`
  - `wallet.js` (initial Phase B value) →
    `sha384-RhWdFOoBDj5QlZ5eRwbYEpB3l2HVjLomt2F99v6OVWklQij/UogtRsNqoEl3P0O2`
    (refreshed to `S7vr1mAtCqz5ww1XEdINXJXYsqupNK3tsjS3a/RO97wbxLlON5grl3/ZrvPsVJgZ`
    at the Session 97 v0.4.0 landing pill bump).
- **OpenAPI doc.** `QSD/docs/docs/openapi.yaml` gains a full
  entry for `/wallet/submit-signed` documenting the request/response
  bodies, the canonical signing-payload contract, idempotency
  semantics, the 8 `QSD_wallet_send_total{result=…}` tags, and
  the two v0.4.0 known gaps.
- **MINER_QUICKSTART Appendix B.** Split the "Transfer from
  existing CELL holder" path into two rows — validator-signed
  (`/wallet/send`, requires the CELL holder to own a validator
  enrollment) and self-custody (`/wallet/submit-signed`, signed in
  the holder's browser tab, no validator-side wallet needed).
- **Audit row.** `api-06` flipped from BACKEND IMPLEMENTED →
  FULLY IMPLEMENTED with the in-line gap-tracking preserved.
- **Status update on
  [`V040_WALLET_SEND_DESIGN.md`](QSD/docs/docs/V040_WALLET_SEND_DESIGN.md):**
  Phase A + Phase B both marked SHIPPED. Future-work section
  retains the per-account nonce + atomic debit/credit items.

**Closing state of Session 96.** All v0.4.0 source-tree work is
complete on commit `318ed5e` — handler, route, rate-limit,
metric tags, tests, WASM helper, browser tab, OpenAPI, runbook,
audit row. **No production deploy yet** — that ships in
Session 97.

### Session 97 — v0.4.0 tag cut + BLR1 deploy + supply-chain evidence

What this session does: take the source-tree-complete v0.4.0 code
from Session 96 (`318ed5e`) and produce a publicly-verifiable
production release with live anchors.

**What landed:**

1. **Push two unpushed Phase A + Phase B commits** to
   `origin/main` (`0984a98..318ed5e`). Clean fast-forward; no
   force-push.
2. **Annotated tag `v0.4.0` at `318ed5e`** with the full release
   description inline (headline, at-a-glance, known v0.4.0 gaps,
   what's safe to publish, pending external blockers). Pushed to
   origin.
3. **`release-container.yml` run `25811046765`** — fired
   automatically on the tag push. **10/10 jobs green**: 5
   per-platform binary builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64,
   darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64), source SBOM,
   3 GHCR image builds (`QSD`, `QSD-validator`, `QSD-miner`),
   and the attach-binaries-and-signatures step. 53 cosign-signed
   assets attached to the release page (15 binaries + 17 `.sig`
   + 17 `.pem` + 3 SBOMs + `SHA256SUMS`).
4. **Cosign + Rekor evidence pass** documented in
   [`RELEASE_EVIDENCE_v0.4.0.md`](QSD/docs/docs/RELEASE_EVIDENCE_v0.4.0.md).
   7/7 supply-chain checks green: SHA256SUMS,
   `QSDminer-console-linux-amd64`, `QSD-source-sbom.spdx.json`,
   `ghcr.io/quantum-ledger/QSD:0.4.0`,
   `ghcr.io/quantum-ledger/QSD-validator:0.4.0`,
   `ghcr.io/quantum-ledger/QSD-miner:0.4.0`, and binary
   content-hash anchor (`7009d562dfb302ed…3e2e8711`). The
   evidence file also pins the OCI manifest-list digests
   (`sha256:00ccc73d…1325`, `sha256:a6cff859…ac28e`,
   `sha256:5176fb9c…1590`) for tag-immune verification, and the
   `wallet.wasm` SRI hash for browser-wallet integrity.
5. **BLR1 binary swap.** Cross-compiled `cmd/QSD` on Windows
   (`go.exe build -trimpath -ldflags '-s -w -X ...buildinfo.Version=v0.4.0
   -X ...buildinfo.GitSHA=318ed5e -X ...buildinfo.BuildDate=2026-05-13T16:05:00Z'
   -o QSD-v0.4.0-linux-amd64 ./cmd/QSD`), validated locally
   (`SubmitSignedTransaction` and `/wallet/submit-signed` strings
   present in the 30.96 MB ELF; sha256
   `2874f088039bace6662754e2461c1f229b223a42deefc185fae5270e46d6d4fb`),
   scp'd to BLR1, stopped `QSD.service`, swapped
   `/opt/QSD/QSD` (backup at `/opt/QSD/QSD.v033.bak`), bumped
   `QSD_BUILD_VERSION` to `v0.4.0` in
   `/etc/systemd/system/QSD.service.d/version.conf`, reloaded
   systemd, restarted. **All journalctl lines clean** — chain
   restored from disk (`tip_height=57743`, `accounts_loaded=38`,
   `enrollments_loaded=3`, `receipts_loaded=56436`), v2
   attestation dispatcher wired, spec-check baseline loaded.
6. **Live-environment verification.** Per
   `RELEASE_EVIDENCE_v0.4.0.md` "Live-environment anchors"
   table: `https://api.QSD.tech/api/v1/status` now reports
   `"version":"v0.4.0"`; `POST /api/v1/wallet/submit-signed` with
   body `{}` returns **HTTP 400 + `"invalid sender address: ...
   cannot be empty"`** (proves the handler is in the routing
   tree, parsed the JSON, and rejected on the first contract
   check exactly as designed); GET on the same path returns
   **HTTP 405 + `"method not allowed"`** (proves route is
   registered POST-only). On v0.3.3 both probes returned HTTP
   302 — the status-code split is the strong route-registered
   signal that the v0.4.0 handler is now serving.
7. **QSD.tech landing pill bump.** `QSD/deploy/landing/index.html`
   ver-pill text `v0.3.3 → v0.4.0`, GitHub release link bumped,
   funding caveat rewritten to surface the new Send tab path,
   Current release lead paragraph rewritten around self-custody
   Send. `wallet.js` funding-caveat string also bumped. `wallet.js`
   SRI hash recomputed
   (`S7vr1mAtCqz5ww1XEdINXJXYsqupNK3tsjS3a/RO97wbxLlON5grl3/ZrvPsVJgZ`)
   and installed in `wallet.html`. WASM SRI unchanged (3.88 MB
   binary already deployed in Session 96 — but BLR1 had only the
   3.24 MB pre-v0.4 build; pushed the correct 3.88 MB build now,
   so the public sha384 over `https://QSD.tech/wallet.wasm`
   matches the SRI in `wallet.js` byte-for-byte:
   `XKMSFMnk27ul5OLXqm2zFMPtsdSVUGNXK8sChbKc/Y2nIqVLEB330Ll+UDhz0Eb6`).
8. **Backups preserved on BLR1:**
   - Binary: `/opt/QSD/QSD.v033.bak`
     (sha256 `4ceefbb75b04b1d472d2a94ec6cccdc35ce045b29e1455eef4add0f06a5dc876`).
   - Landing dir: `/var/www/QSD.v033.bak.20260513T161123Z/`.

**Risk profile of the v0.4.0 deploy.** Same as v0.3.3 — solo
validator (no peer set to coordinate with), backup binary on
disk, ~5-second cold-start chain restore from disk on
`systemctl restart`. The two `mining/submit` requests in the
post-deploy journal tail (last 5 lines) confirm in-flight mining
work survived the swap (`POST /api/v1/mining/submit status:200
duration_ms:2`). No data-plane state was touched — `chain.ndjson`,
`accounts.json`, `enrollment.json`, `receipts.ndjson`, NGC
attestation persistence (`store-05`), and the libp2p host key
(`net-05`) all carry forward.

## What's safe to publish today (post-publish status)

These artefacts are sign-off-ready and can be shipped the moment the corresponding external blocker clears:

- ✅ **GHCR container images** (`QSD`, `QSD-validator`, `QSD-miner` `:0.4.0`). **Published and live.** `release-container.yml` keyless-signs them via Sigstore OIDC and attaches an SPDX 2.3 SBOM as a cosign attestation. v0.4.0 verification re-run on 2026-05-13 — see [`RELEASE_EVIDENCE_v0.4.0.md`](QSD/docs/docs/RELEASE_EVIDENCE_v0.4.0.md) for manifest-list digests and reproduction commands.
- ✅ **Linux / Windows / macOS binaries** (`QSDminer-console`, `trustcheck`, `genesis-ceremony` × 5 platforms = 15 binaries) with cosign signatures and a source SBOM. **Published and verified.** v0.4.0 release page carries 53 cosign-signed assets total. Reproducible with `cosign verify-blob` (see `V030_POST_RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md` §"Step 4" and `RELEASE_EVIDENCE_v0.4.0.md` §"Reproducing this evidence").
- ✅ **BLR1 production validator at v0.4.0.** `https://api.QSD.tech/api/v1/status` reports `"version":"v0.4.0"`; the new self-custody endpoint `/api/v1/wallet/submit-signed` is live and reachable from the public domain (POST `{}` → HTTP 400 invalid-sender, GET → HTTP 405 method-not-allowed). v0.3.3 binary preserved at `/opt/QSD/QSD.v033.bak` for rollback.
- ✅ **QSD.tech landing pill + browser-wallet Send tab.** Pill text and GitHub release link both at v0.4.0; new self-custody Send tab live at `https://QSD.tech/wallet/`; `wallet.wasm` and `wallet.js` SRI hashes on the served files match the in-tree integrity hashes byte-for-byte.
- ⏳ **`QSD-sdk@0.3.0` on npm.** Re-push tag `sdk-js-v0.3.0` (moved to the post-rename commit); the `.github/workflows/sdk-javascript-publish.yml` workflow validates that the tag suffix matches `package.json`, re-runs the test suite as a `prepublishOnly` gate, and runs `npm publish --provenance --access public`. External blocker: `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret with 2FA-bypass (the previous attempt under the bare name `QSD` was rejected by the registry's typo-squatting heuristic — see *Session 81*; the package was renamed `QSD-sdk` to satisfy that check while preserving the QSD brand).

## Remaining external blockers

These are the items the repo cannot close itself. They are tracked individually in `pkg/audit/checklist.go` (visible via `cmd/auditreport`) and at the top of `NEXT_STEPS.md` (operator-local).

| ID | Blocker | Owner | What unlocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rebrand-03` | Trademark filings for "QSD" and "Cell (CELL)" | Counsel | Paid advertising; legally safe public launch. |
| `tok-01` | Tokenomics genesis policy sign-off (100 M cap, 10 M treasury, 90 M mining, 4-year halvings) | Counsel + foundation | Mainnet genesis ceremony. |
| `mining-01` | External audit of `MINING_PROTOCOL.md` + `pkg/mining` | Independent cryptography / consensus auditor | CUDA miner public release. Auditor entry-point: `QSD/docs/docs/AUDIT_PACKET_MINING.md`. |
| `mining-05` | Incentivised testnet launch | Ops + marketing | Real-world stress of the reference miner before mainnet emission begins. |
| `supply-08` | Upstream fix for `GO-2024-3218` (libp2p-kad-dht) | go-libp2p maintainers | Removes the only accepted-with-mitigation entry. Practical exposure already bounded by bootstrap allowlist + peer scoring. |
| — | `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret (2FA-bypass) | Ops | npm publish of `QSD-sdk@0.3.0` (renamed from `QSD` after the registry's name-similarity heuristic rejected the bare name; see *Session 81*). |
| — | `APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION` + `APPLE_NOTARYTOOL_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` | Ops with Apple Developer account | Notarised macOS binaries. Scaffold: `QSD/scripts/notarize_macos.sh`. |
| — | Mainnet genesis ceremony | Foundation + validator set | After `tok-01` and `mining-01` clear. Dry-run driver at `cmd/genesis-ceremony` flags every artefact `dry_run: true`. |

## Annotated-tag templates

The two tag annotations below are pre-drafted so the operator can copy them verbatim once external blockers clear.

### `v0.3.0` (Go core)

```
QSD v0.3.0

In-repo release. Verified at HEAD de2bf30 (session 73), re-confirmed
in session 74:
  * go test ./... -count=1 (non-short) -> 67/67 packages OK
  * govulncheck ./...                   -> 1 finding (GO-2024-3218,
                                           tracked as supply-08)
  * go mod verify                       -> all modules verified
  * 10-min pubsub soak (4 hosts)        -> 239,987 publishes,
                                           per-host receive spread
                                           = 6 msgs across 600 s
  * 10-min mempool soak (8 producers)   -> 19.1 M txs at 31.9 K tx/s

External blockers tracked in pkg/audit/checklist.go (rebrand-03,
tok-01, mining-01, mining-05, supply-08).
```

### `sdk-js-v0.3.0` (JavaScript SDK)

```
QSD-sdk@0.3.0 (JavaScript SDK) -- published 2026-05-11

Feature parity with sdk/go. 17/17 node:test cases pass. Tarball:
6 files, 6.7 kB packed, 18.7 kB unpacked (manifest:
package.json + QSD.js + QSD.d.ts + README.md + CHANGELOG.md +
LICENSE). Sigstore provenance attached at publish time
(Rekor logIndex 1506353451, SLSA v1 predicate).

Registry:  https://www.npmjs.com/package/QSD-sdk/v/0.3.0
Tarball:   https://registry.npmjs.org/QSD-sdk/-/QSD-sdk-0.3.0.tgz
shasum:    c4e53da187d25bbb2fd4a15c477c12ec7a0c62c1
SLSA URL:  https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/attestations/QSD-sdk@0.3.0

The bare name `QSD` was rejected by npm's typo-squatting
heuristic on first attempt; the package was renamed to
`QSD-sdk` (see Session 81). The repo, GHCR images, binaries,
on-chain brand, and the import-time QSDClient symbol all
keep the original QSD naming. The Rekor record for the
rejected first attempt is preserved at logIndex 1506312160.
